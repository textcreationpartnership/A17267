            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Howeuer they, by this, make it appeare before hand, that they are reſolued not to permit this tract to goe without a ſcratcht face, ſo ſoone as their nailes can come at it. I am therfore constrained for defence thereof to avouch, that I can (if need require) make it good by aboue <hi>500</hi> Witneſſes, that I haue beene ſo punctuall in ſetting downe, in this booke, the maine poſition which I first deliuered that I haue put it into the very ſame termes formerly vſed, without the least variation. I willingly confeſſe, that in the proſecution of the point, I haue here added ſome things by way of further illustration; and ſome alſo, for more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple confirmation; and preſſed ſome obiections further then the ſtreights of time would then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. And if for this I be to blame, let wiſe men iudge.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> Whereas most of the obiections pordu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and anſwered in this treatiſe, haue beene
<pb facs="tcp:7446:6"/> firſt vrged vpon me in private conference, or ſent me in writing by ſundry friends, whoſe worth I reuerence, &amp; whoſe loue I much affect, notwithſtanding their diſſent from me in this particular; I must craue leaue to profeſſe and protest before him that knoweth all things, that my aime is not ſo much as in my ſecret thoughts, to despiſe or disparage any of them hereby: but only to ſet downe their arguments, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by occaſion might be taken, more throughly to diſcuſſe this ſubiect. It is true that I haue ſometimes made vſe of the ſame phraſes firſt vſed by my friends to me: yet I deſire them to take notice that I haue only weighed their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments impartially in the ballance of reaſon and truth, without the leaſt glaunce vpon any of their perſons. And if I could haue beene aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained that none but they would euer haue lighted on the ſame obiections, I could as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly haue ſuppreſſed them; as J doe the names of the obiectors. But becauſe what friends doe octiect in loue, others may alſo preſſe to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of this truth, I haue made bold to make thoſe arguments thus publique, that their
<pb facs="tcp:7446:7"/> mouthes may be ſtopped, who elſe might happen to vrge the ſame with violence and paſſion enough, and thinke them vnanſwerable, if there ſhould no anſweres be ſent out to meet them. For their ſakes therfore haue J thus preſumed on my friends (whom I earneſtly deſire ſtill to hold deare vnto me,) hoping they will not bethinke it to the publique good, nor hold themſelues diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraged hereby, but rather reioice that they haue beene a meanes of a more exquiſite debate of this point, wherby the truth may be better knowne.</p>

               <hi>3</hi> I haue a requeſt to all that ſhall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to make vſe of this booke, that they will be at the paines to read ouer the whole, or forbeare to cenſure it by any peece therof, that they may happen to caſt their eye vpon. For, in a point of controverſy, wherein method requires only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in one part, confirmation in another; refutation in another; and often references from one part of the diſcourſe vnto other places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for avoiding of confuſion and tedious repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: it is impoſſible to receiue full ſatiſfaction by reading any one peece only, how ſatiſfactorie
<pb facs="tcp:7446:7"/> ſoeuer it may proue when it is conſidered alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and when the reſt is pervſed and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well as that branch on which haſty and forward cenſurers doe ſometimes paſſe a ſharpe and heavy ſentence. If you pervſe the firſt part of this booke only, without the reſidue, yee may perhaps obiect divers things, and remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiſfied becauſe ye goe not on to the latter part wherein all ſuch obiections together with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to them, doe preſent themſelues in their proper rankes. On the contrary, if wee looke only on the latter part to ſee how the maine obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be anſwered, yee may ſometimes haply ſticke (through your owne fault) at ſome of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres, becauſe I take ſundry things for graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which ye may doubt of till ye haue read the former part, wherein the ſame things are proued at large, and to which, in my anſwers the rules of Method often compell mee to referre you.

               <p>For proofe hereof, I ſhall not need to thruſt any mans head ſo much as Within the doore of that Augaean ſtable of Popiſh ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities. we haue too many inſtances elſe where. Some aduance Baptiſme too high: Others depreſſe it as much too low. There are, that hold it ſo <hi>abſolutely</hi> neceſſary, as that <hi>none</hi> can be ſaued without it.

Againſt all theſe errors, and particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the laſt, the <hi>Church of England</hi> hath iuſtly oppoſed her ſelfe, in her <hi>Publique Doctrine,</hi> for the defence whereof haue I ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon me this difficult province.

               <p>In the courſe of my miniſtry, in mine own cure, I was lately<note n="*" place="margin">In Hilary Terme. <hi>1627.</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7446:11"/> pleaſeth. As for the reſt of the elect who dye infants, I will not deny a further worke, ſometimes in, ſometimes before baptiſme, to fit them for heauen.</p>
               <p>For this, am I peremptorily cenſured and condemned by many, as guilty not only of <hi>Arminianiſme,</hi> but euen of direct <hi>Popery,</hi> and of teaching a <hi>Doctrine of diuells.</hi> To make good what they haue done, they lay to my charge ſundry paſſages, as branches of my poſition, which, not only in <hi>ſtating</hi> the queſtion, but alſo in the <hi>proſecution</hi> of it, I often and often diſclaimed as <hi>errors,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe termes. This they know well enough; &amp; it hath bin made manifeſt to ſome of their faces by others alſo. Howbeit, they owing me a ſpite for ſome thing elſe, (as by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect appeares) take no notice of their wilfull miſtakes. That which they haue once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, they are reſolued to maintaine; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ceaſe not to purſue me with cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, ſlanders, and revilings without end or meaſure. No proteſtations of mine owne, either publique or priuate, no Apologies made by my friends, are able to ſhelter mee
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7446:11"/> from their virulent dartes which daily fly in my face where euer I become.</p>
               <p>This alone were cauſe ſufficient of publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> that I may purge my ſelfe of theſe odious crimes ſo vniuſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. He that being a Miniſter is not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to vphold his neceſſary reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people of God, as well as to keepe a good conſcience towards God, is both cruell to himſelfe,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and iniurious to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. His Miniſtry muſt needs bee of leſſe eſteeme, if not deſpiſed out-right, who ſhall ſuffer himſelfe to bee proclaimed guilty of <hi>Error,</hi> and <hi>Hereſie;</hi> and ſees his Good Name hang'd vp in chaines by the giddy multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, even before his owne doores, and hee not endeauour, in a meet &amp; temperate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to declare himſelfe innocent, when he is well able to plead, <hi>not guilty,</hi> to the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>If any man ſhall ſay; <hi>Jt is a mans honour to paſſe by offences,</hi> and therefore it had beene farre better to haue endured a while, with patience, the tongues of intemperate men, then thus to haue ſpred the cauſe before the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7446:12"/> whole world: this courſe being likely more to exaſperate, rather then to ſatisfie or molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſuch as haue appeared in oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. To ſuch a perſon mine anſwere is this. If the wrong had not trenched ſo much vpon the credit of my Miniſtry (which ought to bee as deare vnto me, as any mans is to him;) or if I had beene handled thus in priuate onely, by priuate men, I could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly haue borne all that reproach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy that is laid vpon me, without complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but, not without bewailing, with a bleeding heart, the ſtrange pride and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ſuch ſpirits as dare thus wilfully to traduce any Miniſter of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>That which hath imbarked mee in this publique action is of more importance then the maintaining of mine owne innocency againſt the murmur of priuate perſons: yea there are many weighty cauſes concurring to put vpon mee a neceſſity of doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this kinde. If any ſhall take occaſion hence to be more exaſperated, it ſhall be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his owne fault: for I hope I ſhall ſo man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age this worke, that it ſhall evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7446:12"/> to all Godly, Iudicious, temperate men, that I no where giue any cauſe of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vnto any peaceable Chriſtian; but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour only, in a modeſt and humble ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to cleare and maintaine a Truth, and to giue all ſatisfaction that I may, vnto ſuch as loue Truth better then Victory.</p>
               <p>Breifly, the <hi>Cauſes</hi> cheifly enducing mee to ſend theſe Papers vnto the Preſſe, are theſe Three.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The iuſt Defence of the publique doctrine of our Church, which hath beene by ſome, vpon this occaſion, publiquely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſo farre as they durſt.

               <p>
                  <hi>But, he ſaith not this of</hi> ALL <hi>elect Infants?</hi> In common conſtruction his ſpeech muſt be equivalent to an Vniverſall. For, when he <hi>distinguiſheth of infants, whereof,</hi> hee ſaith, <hi>ſome are elect, and ſome belong not to the Election of Grace:</hi> doth hee not giue vs a generall diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution? Be there, in his iudgment, ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants that are neither <hi>elect,</hi> nor <hi>not-elect?</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, when hee ſpeaketh of ſuch as are <hi>not elect;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>theſe latter receiue only the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7446:28"/> element;</hi> doth hee not meane, in any mans apprehenſion, ALL theſe receiue only the outward element? Then, by the rule of oppoſition, when he comes to ſpeak to the other member of his Diſtinction; and to ſay, the <hi>Former (viz:</hi> the Elect) <hi>receaue, in the right vſe of the Sacrament the</hi> INWARD GRACE; can any reaſonable Creature of the ſlendreſt capacity beyond a child, take him to meane leſſe then ALL the Elect?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yes,</hi> you will ſay, <hi>they may, and ought to take him to meane leſſe; for himſelfe ſaith expreſly, not that hereby wee tie the Maieſtie of God to any time or meanes, whoſe ſpirit bloweth when and where hee liſteth; on</hi> SOME, BEFORE; <hi>on</hi> SOME, AFTER? Well. And what followes hence, but only this; that howeuer God hath ſet downe this to be the <hi>ordinary</hi> courſe which hee ties <hi>Vs</hi> vnto; yet it is not to be denied, but that hee can, and ſometimes doth, <hi>extraordinarily,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his ſpirit, at other times? Now this makes nothing againſt me: for I neuer ſaid that <hi>All</hi> ABSOLVTLY; but, <hi>All,</hi> ORDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARILY, <hi>doe receiue the Spirit, in Baptiſme.</hi> And ſo much this Author muſt yeeld mee
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7446:28"/> out of his owne words. For hee that ſaith that the <hi>Elect doe receiue the inward Grace;</hi> and that God, <hi>ordinarily,</hi> doth <hi>accompany the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with his Grace;</hi> although he put a <hi>correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of his words, for the explication of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that hee ſpeakes not this as laying an <hi>abſolute tye</hi> vpon God; he can bee no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vnderſtood then thus: <hi>viz.</hi> that in ſome <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>speciall</hi> caſes, it <hi>may</hi> bee, and <hi>is</hi> otherwiſe. To what end elſe ſhould he add the word, ORDINARY. It is true that God is not <hi>abſolutly tied to times, and meanes:</hi> and, what euer he doth, he doth it moſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but yet when God hath ſet vp a ſtanding Ordinance in his Church, and made ſuch a <hi>promiſe</hi> of the <hi>preſence</hi> and <hi>beſtowing</hi> of his grace, as may giue his people ground to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it; and hath bound them to <hi>ſend out the Prayer of</hi> FAITH <hi>for it;</hi> hee that ſhall ſay that God hath not tyed and engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ORDINARILY to giue the Grace promiſed; or, that to beleeue this, is, to tye God, where he hath not tied himſelfe; ſpeaks not like a Divine, but makes God a Lier.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Author hath expreſſed himſelfe, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7446:29"/> it is but ſometimes, and in ſome ſpeciall caſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Elect receiue the Spirit, in Baptiſme?</hi> Then he contradicts himſelfe, when hee ſaith, that God, ORDINARILY, <hi>accompanies it with his Grace?</hi> I tooke not vpon me to quote what he <hi>ſpeakes</hi> either in private or publique; but what he hath <hi>written</hi> vpon <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. where he ſaith, this is done ORDINARILY.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well, but when all is done, this Author doth not poſitiuely determine the point, but onely speake what, in charity, may probably be coniectured: for he ſaith, We want wherewith to drawe certainty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution?</hi> It is true, Hee ſaith ſo indeed: but what then are thoſe collections out of the SCRIPTVRES, and EXPOSITORS, hee after talkes of? They are but <hi>probable conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,</hi> you will ſay. True: yet he ſaith, that, what he here deliuereth, is MOST PROBA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE. I looke for no more: for what could he ſay more, that is not divinely inſpired with an infallible ſpirit, which no man takes this Author to be. Yet hee ſaith enough af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, to make the laſt words a plaine contradiction to the firſt, if he would be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this ſenſe; viz: that <hi>he speakes only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecturally;</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:7446:29"/> and profeſſes, that, <hi>if any ſhould aske him, whether any elect infant doe receiue the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Baptiſme?</hi> hee would anſwere, <hi>that hee cannot tell.</hi> For mark, hee that ſaith, firſt, that this is not <hi>certaine</hi> whether elect infants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the inward grace, in Baptiſme, or not; yet afterwards ſaith, that they <hi>doe receiue it;</hi> that, by <hi>virtue of</hi> HIS PROMISE, <hi>wee may expect it;</hi> and, <hi>here we</hi> MAY, <hi>and</hi> OVGHT <hi>ſend out the</hi> PRAYER <hi>of</hi> FAITH for it; what doth he but contradict himſelfe? Will not a PROMISE, (where, the promiſe is to bee found, lies vpon the Author to ſhew; if any man doubt thereof;) will not the <hi>Prayer of Faith,</hi> which wee OVGHT to put vp to God, make this thing <hi>certaine?</hi> Againe, if the thing be yet <hi>vncertaine,</hi> why doth hee collect ſuch a <hi>certaine vſe</hi> of comfort from this very diſcourſe of his? For afterwards, making <hi>vſe</hi> of the point, he ſaith (<hi>pag.</hi> 647.) <hi>What a comfort is it for a Father to ſee his child waſhed with the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt? clenſed from ſinne? Set into the viſible Church;</hi> YEA, INTO THE BODY OF CHRIST, <hi>in the right vſe of the Sacrament, wherein a Parent ought more to reioice, then if hee
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7446:30"/> could make it heyre of the world.</hi> And doe I yet miſtake this Author? Or rather, are not they Incendiaries Who haue bruited it abroad; endeavoring to ſet him and me at oddes, if it were poſſible? Yea, doe they not by ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports (as daily fly vp &amp; downe) of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of his iudgement to this point, doe what in them lies to endamage him more then either he (<hi>I</hi> hope) will deſerue; or then thoſe <hi>Boutifeu's</hi> will bee able euer to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence againe vnto him; if notice ſhould bee taken thereof, by ſome, that <hi>watch for our hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> and <hi>make a man a tranſgreſſor for a word?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus haue I cleared both my Author, &amp; quitted my ſelfe of the vniuſt imputation of doing him wrong. His iudgment, thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording with mine, will, I hope, ſomewhat allay their heat and fury, who, for this point, accuſe both mee of <hi>Arminianiſme;</hi> and our Church, of <hi>Popery.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ:</hi> It is true, our Church doth indeed teach

But the <hi>judgment of charity</hi> muſt haue a certaine foundation to build vpon; elſe it is not the iudgment of charity, but fooliſh and ſinfull credulity void of all iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For, vnleſſe ſuch a thing bee true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of ſome infants, yea, ordinarily, of all that belong to Gods election, I am not bound to beleeue it of euery one, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of divine diſpenſation; nay I am bound, not to beleeue it, no, not ſo much as in charity. For charity beleeues nothing but things poſſible, and probable; yea, more probable then the contrary; and things ſometimes certainely true of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the ſame kinde.</p>
               <p>No charity could bind mee to beleeue Peter to be a reaſonable creature, if it were not certaine to me that ſome men, that all
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7446:31"/> men were ſuch. I am not tyed to beleeue this Profeſſor to be an honeſt man, no not by the bonds of charity, if it were certaine to mee that no Profeſſor is an honeſt man. I were not bound, in the iudgment of charity to beleeue that any of thoſe ſtragling Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Hearers that in ſuch multitudes, flockt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me, while I preached this point, more then at other times, did come for any other end then either to beare ſome <hi>new thing,</hi> meerly out of curioſity; or to catch &amp; carp, to wreſt my words, to run away with wilful miſtakes, to cenſure and iudge, to hope to ſee me foyled and ſhamed, becauſe forſooth I deliuered that which they haue hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore raſhly and vnſoundly taught, or vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably learned; and becauſe I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale a truth which might convince them of error, &amp;c. vnleſſe it were either certainly knowne vnto me, or vpon certaine ground to be preſumed, that ſome, yea that many are better affected, and more humbly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly minded.</p>
               <p>There muſt be a certainty in the Theſis; elſe no iudgment of charity bindes a man to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7446:31"/> beleeue any thing in the Hypotheſis. Nor is it charity, but folly, that I ſhould beleeue Peter receiues the ſpirit, in Baptiſme; if hee that bids me beleeue it of him, will not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant me to beleeue it as a thing certaine of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at all. And it were a very vncharitable ſpeech to ſay, that our Church meant to ſtretch my charity to beleeue impoſſibilities or improbabilities, or that which is neuer, yea; not (ordinarily) certainely done. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Church (when it teacheth me to beleeue, in charity, that this, and that, and t'other infant receiue the ſpirit for initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all regeneration, in Baptiſme) teacheth and requireth me, (vpon this ground, that, for ought I know of thoſe particulars they are elected,) to beleeue her meaning to be this, that there are <hi>ſome,</hi> yea, that <hi>all</hi> elect infants, doe <hi>ordinarily,</hi> receiue the ſpirit of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Baptiſme, from the hand of Chriſt, truly and indeed</p>

Now then to qualify an infant, it is ſufficient that he be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Couenant. If he be borne of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian parents, hee is ſo farre forth to be held within the couenant, that the Church ought to admit him to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, if he be preſented to it.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7446:34"/> what they ſay, or whereof they affirme. And it is a blind conceit of Anabaptiſts to ſay, that no infants are capable of the inward Grace of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, vnleſſe they haue actuall faith and doe actually beleeue.</item>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7446:41"/> as I haue before ſhewed, in that it preſumeth the child to be one to whom <hi>belongs the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God;</hi> vpon which ground wee are taught <hi>not to doubt but ſtedfaſtly to beleeue that he will favorably receaue the preſent infant; that he will imbrace him with the armes of his mercy, that hee will giue vnto him the bleſſing of eternall life, and make him partaker of his everlaſting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Againe in the end of the praier which is appointed to be vſed immediatly before the act of baptiſme in the name of the Father &amp; of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt, wee pray that the children may <hi>receaue the fulnes of Gods Grace and ever remaine in the number of his faithfull and</hi> ELECT <hi>children:</hi> which ſhewes plainly that the Church ſuppoſeth that all ſuch as doe indeed receaue the Spirit in their baptiſme, bee of the number of Gods <hi>Elect.</hi> And ſo <hi>Bucer</hi> expounded it of old, as ſhall hereafter appeare in due place<note n="*" place="margin">See Cap. 6.</note>, when we come to ſhew the judgment of forraigne Divines in this point.</p>
               <p>Nor is this to bee put off with that new coyned diſtinction of election to <hi>Grace</hi> and not to <hi>Glory.</hi> For the Leiturgie ſpeaks onely
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7446:41"/> of Election to glory, inaſmuch as it had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs before, that God will giue vnto the infant baptized, <hi>the bleſſing of eternall life, and make him partaker of his euerlaſting kingdome</hi> &amp; ſo concluds this prayer, that the infants may be <hi>inheritors of his euerlasting kingdome through Chriſt our lord.</hi> And why ſhould any preſume to obtrude vpon the Church ſuch a diſtinction which hath not the leaſt ſhew of any footing in the word of God? For how euer I deny not but that the ſcripture ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſpeaketh of a temporary election of ſome perſons vnto ſome particular offices &amp; ſeruices in the Church of God; yet it neuer ſpeakes of election vnto the grace of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but as it is a beginning of glory which certainly followes ſanctification and is vndoubtedly conferred on all that are ſanctified: ſo as no man is elected to the one but he is elected vnto the other alſo.

               <p>That I may more methodically proceed, and diſpatch more ſpeedily that which I haue to alledg out of the Scriptures, I muſt neceſſarily bind my ſelfe to the lawes of Argumentation, wrapping vp the force of my Arguments in ſome plaine <hi>Syllogiſmes</hi> (as as I haue done in the former chapter,) and confirming the ſeuerall propoſitions that need proofe, by expreſſe ſcriptures, expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſuch learned expoſitors, as mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries pretend moſt reſpect vnto. By this
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7446:44"/> courſe I ſhall be ſure not to abuſe my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, if they be able to iudge of reaſon When they ſee it.</p>

                  <hi>Minor</hi> But the Scriptures doe attribute the confirming of the Holy Ghoſt, to that ordinance, as a principall part of it.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> Propoſition, me thinkes ſhould not be doubted of by any; vnleſſe by <hi>Sacramentarians:</hi> for, will any man of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding deny vnto the elect that wich the ſcriptures doe euery where attribute as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7446:45"/> the cheife part, and as it were the ſoule and life of that ordinance of baptiſme? If any man ſhall doe ſo, he muſt grant that elect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants doe receiue but a peece of baptiſme; the ſhell, without the Kernell; the body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſoule. And if this be true, to what end are they baptized? If they be not, euen in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, capable of the principall part of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, why are they admitted to it? How ſhall wee anſwere the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> who pleade from hence, againſt the baptizing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, that they are not capable of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace? If that be true Which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Ames</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>they be as capable of baptiſme, in reſpect of the cheife vſe thereof, as perſons of yeares;</hi> who ſhall deny them the inward grace? Doe we not know that in Gods account, the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of circumciſion was not accounted circumciſion, when it was only outward in-the fleſh, and not inward alſo in the heart? <hi>For, he is not a Iew which is one outwardly; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that circumciſion, which is outward in the fleſh. But he is a Iew which is one inwardly; and circumciſion is that of the heart in the ſpirit, and not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men but of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7446:45"/> God. Rom.</hi> 2. Circumciſion We know, was <hi>a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe which is by faith</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">6. Rom 4.11.</note>. Now I demand, whether any ſound diuine did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer affirme that only the outward ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of circumciſion of the fleſh, was vnto the elect the proper and only ſeale of the righteouſneſſe which is by faith?

If then Circumciſion were accounted vncircumciſion, where it was not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the inward grace; what ſhall we ſay other of baptiſme, where the ſpirit is not communicated? Therefore alſo in baptiſme of the elect (for whoſe ſakes only, this and all other ordinances of Chriſt were ſet vp in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is ordinarily conferred, which in Gods account is no better then no baptiſme; or, Baptiſme is not to infants what the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures affirme it to be to men of yeares. And
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7446:46"/> if this laſt be true, in the ordinary courſe of diuine diſpenſation; I will maintaine, that <hi>infants are not to be baptiſed.</hi> If thoſe infants which may bee ſaued without baptiſme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue no more then the outward ſigne when they are baptized, why are they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? Can the outward ſigne ſaue them; or make them more certaine or more cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able of ſalvation then they were before, ſo long as they remaine void of faith? Were it not as good to deferre their baptiſme till they be of yeares; as to offer them to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in infancy which doth them no more good, then it doth to a reprobate, till their actuall converſion? To ſay that Baptiſme admits them to the outward meanes, is to ſay iuſt nothing to the purpoſe. For, aske theſe men, what is it that makes a perſon capable of the inward grace of baptiſme. They will anſwer; faith. But, how is this faith wrought? By preaching of the word; ſay they. Well; admit this: may not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant vnbaptiſed come to heare the word read or preached: Anabaptiſts doe not ſhut their children out of the Church when the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7446:46"/> word is preached, but onely exclude them from the Sacraments. And wee alſo permit excommunicate perſons to heare Sermons, howeuer we debarre them from other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Therefore infants need not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme meerly for their admiſſion vnto the outward meanes of faith and conuerſion, for as much as they may participate of the word without baptiſme, and the word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by theſe mens telling, the onely outward ordinary meanes of begetting faith. If Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts might as freely ſhew themſelues here among vs, as they doe in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, this doctrine of Baptiſmal grace would bee better entertained by ſuch as now op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne it without conſideration of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele. This therefore to mee is without all controuerſie, that, <hi>What the Scriptures doe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to Baptiſme as the principall part and as it were the ſoule of Baptiſme, is, ordinarily, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from Christ vnto the Elect, although infants</hi> (becauſe in them actuall faith is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) <hi>in their baptiſme.</hi> Where the Scripture makes no difference, why ſhould we?</p>

               <p>The firſt is that in <hi>Math:</hi> 3.11. <hi>I indeed baptize you with water vnto repentance: but hee that commeth after me is mightier then I, whoſe ſhooes I am not worthy to beare, he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire.</hi> In which place Iohn makes the Baptiſme of Chriſt to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7446:48"/> conſiſt non onely of <hi>Water,</hi> but of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and of the <hi>powerful operation</hi> of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt metaphorically deſcribed vnder the terme of <hi>Fire.</hi> Nor can it be vnderſtood, either of baptiſme adminiſtred by Chriſt in his owne perſon, (<hi>for Ieſus himſelfe baptized not; but, his Diſciples</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 4.2.</note>) or only of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts of the ſpirit conferred on the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to worke miracles, and to ſpeake with tongues<note n="h" place="margin">Act. 2.2.3.4. vid. Luk. 24 49 Act. 1.4.5.</note>: but it is meant alſo of that which all the elect may expect in the right vſe of that ordinance, by virtue of Chriſts Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ordinarily, when his Miniſters doe rightly diſpenſe the outward element. For marke, Iohn ſpeakes not this to Chriſts A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles afterwards aſſembled at <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> but to the promiſcuous multitude, that came vnto his Baptiſme. Therefore it cannot bee meant only of thoſe extraordinary gifts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the Apoſtles in the day of <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt;</hi> but of the ordinary courſe of Divine diſpenſation vnto all the elect.</p>
               <p>The better to iuſtifie this expoſition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Apoſtle Peter ſpeakes vnto ſuch as vpon hearing of him, <hi>were pricked in their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7446:48"/> hearts;</hi> and demanded <hi>what they ſhould doe?</hi> For he anſwers thus; <hi>Repent, and bee baptized every one of you, in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, for the the remiſſion of ſinnes, and yee ſhall receaue the gift of the Holy Ghost</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note>. Hee requires them to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> indeed, before Baptiſme, becauſe they were of yeares: but, vpon their baptiſme, hee aſſures them of the Holy Ghoſt to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on every one of them. <hi>True,</hi> you will ſay; <hi>but that was, becauſe they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</hi> I deny that; for howeuer, if they had not repented, being ſuch growne perſons as they were, they had not receaued the Holy Ghoſt: yet their repentance was not the cauſe of their receauing the ſpirit in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; but, Chriſts owne inſtitution &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to accompany his owne ordinance with the inward grace. Elſe, what needed they to bee baptized? For if repentance would certainely fetch the ſpirit; baptiſme in that reſpect, ſhould be ſuperfluous. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not honeſtly be denied that thoſe very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had receaued the ſpirit, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, before baptiſme: how elſe could they haue repented? If then they receaued not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7446:49"/> the ſpirit firſt, vpon their repentance; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it: ſhall this ſeeme a truth impregnable, that infants who cannot actually repent, doe not, ordinarily, receaue the ſpirit in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, for want of repentance? Or can it bee inferred from any of the places before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they ſpeake of the efficacy of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in perſons of yeares only? Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will bee ready yet to preſſe me, that both the place in <hi>Mathew,</hi> and thoſe alleaged out of the <hi>Acts</hi> alſo, doe clearely intend an extraordinary manifeſtation of the ſpirit vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly vpon the men there ſpoken of; and of extraordinary gifts beſtowed on them; and ſo cannot be drawne to proue what is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily conferred in Baptiſme now. But let ſuch conſider that how euer the places doe indeed comprehend an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and meaſure of conferring the ſpirit to thoſe that were then baptized; yet baptiſme was the ordinance wherein thoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts were giuen. And what can this teach vs but that in baptiſme the ſpirit is ſtil beſtowed, although not in like manner or meaſure as at the firſt? That miraculous way
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7446:49"/> of conferring the ſpirit was then neceſſary to gaine honour to the Goſpell from vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers. This neceſſity being remoued, wee haue no reaſon to expect the like extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner of diſpenſation. But becauſe we haue as much need of the ſpirit to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſanctifie vs, as ever they had, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue we even from thence as good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as they to expect the donation of the ſpirit in our baptiſme, ſo farre as the ſpirit is vſefull and neceſſary for vs in theſe times to fit vs for Chriſts worke, and kingdome.</p>
               <p>But ſome will yet obiect, that place in <hi>Mathew</hi> is ſo farre from prouing the actuall conferring of the ſpirit, in baptiſme; that it rather proues the cleane contrary: for Iohn ſpeaking vnto ſuch as he had baptized; ſaith, of Chriſt, HE SHALL baptize; not, HE HATH baptiſed you, with the holy Ghoſt, they therefore did not receaue the ſpirit in baptiſme, but were to expect it as a thing then to come. How then can it follow hence that <hi>Water</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> doe ordinarily goe together in Baptiſme of the Elect?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwere, 1. That it cannot bee
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7446:50"/> proued that this ſpeech was directed vnto ſuch as were baptiſed; although it were vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at that time it was ſpoken to ſuch as came to his Baptiſme, to be rather ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, then to be baptized of him. For the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>verſe</hi> makes it manifeſt that this was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the <hi>Phariſees &amp; Saducees;</hi> who if wee beleeue S. <hi>Luke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 7.30.</note> 
                  <hi>reiected the councell of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelues, and were not baptized of him</hi> i. If this anſwere will not paſſe, then I adde. 2.

               </p>
               <p>A Second place is that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13 <hi>For by one spirit are we all baptized into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp;c.</hi> Here the Apoſtle makes baptiſme to conſiſt chiefely in the ſpirituall inſition of a man into the body of Chriſt by the Holy Ghoſt: as if he would giue vs to vnderſtand that, that deſerues not the name of baptiſme wherein the ſpirit doth not ingraft vs into Chriſt. Nor doth he note this, as ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall priuiledge in extraordinary, conferred only vpon a few; but hee manifeſtly declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to be the common benefit of all that by election belong to Chriſt, when he ſayeth; <hi>by one ſpirit are we</hi> ALL <hi>baptized into one body.</hi>

               <p>Another place to proue that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe attribute the conferring of, and waſhing by the Holy Ghoſt, vnto baptiſme as a principall part of that ordinance, is that in Tit. 3.5. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Baptiſme, deſcribes it to be the <hi>Lauer of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and of the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> in which words it is as cleare as the ſunne at noone day, that baptiſme is not the <hi>Lauer of Regeneration</hi> alone, but of the <hi>renewing of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> alſo: ſo as he that is partaker only of the former, is but halfe baptized: that is, he is partaker but of the body of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without that which giues life, forme &amp; being vnto that ordinance. And, to make the baptiſme of the elect to be no more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7446:52"/> then a participation of the carkaſe of Chriſts inſtitution, would, I thinke, be an harſh doctrine euen in their owne eares, that deny the ſpirit to elect infants. More ſoundly <hi>Caluin</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">in locum.</note>. <hi>The Apoſtles, ſaith hee, are wont euen from ſacraments to draw arguments to confirme vs in aſſurance of our participation of the things therein ſigned and ſealed to vs. For this ought to be an vndenyable principle maintained by all the Godly, that God vſeth not to abuſe his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with empty ſignes, but by his power doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly make good, what by externall ſignes he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth to vs. Wherefore, fitly and truly is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme ſtiled the Lauer of Regeneration.</hi> Now, if Baptiſme be fitly and truly inveſted with this title, becauſe God, doth vndoubtedly make good vnto his owne, inwardly, that which is externally ſignified; who will call that baptiſme, in the language of ſcriptures, that is deſtitute of inward grace?</p>

The ſame neceſſity which lies vpon an infant to haue actuall faith, ere hee can partake of the ſpirit of Regeneration by his baptiſme, will alſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7446:55"/> be as ſtrong to exclude him from participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the outward ſigne. For, baptiſmall waſhing is (at leaſt) ſignificant and obſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant too, ſealing to the party baptized the inward grace ſignified and exhibited, by their owne confeſſion that ſo much quarrel me for this Poſition of <hi>Baptiſmall Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And if ſo, what ſhould an infant doe with this honourable myſtery and ſacred Ordinance, he being not able to put any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between baptiſmall waſhing by the Miniſter, and ordinary waſhing of his face at home by his Nurſe? Now then, if his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent incapacity hinder not his partaking of the outward element, which yet, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of diſpenſation, requires faith to diſcerne the vſe and myſtery of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution, as well as to apply the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace thereby ſignified; what ſhould hinder but that an infant belonging to the election of grace, ſhould partake initially of the grace of the Sacrament, by the Spirit which is in him inſteed of actuall faith? De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him this, and deny him the Scacrament it ſelfe.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:7446:56"/>
               <p>By all this I hope it is now evident out of the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelfe, that either elect infants doe ordinarily partake of the ſpirit, in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; or elſe, they receaue not whole Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, but only a peece if wee conſider this Ordinance, as the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth: <hi>viz:</hi> not only as an outward ſigne, but as that which euer is accompanied with the inward grace to all that are elected.</p>
               <p>My other Arguments drawne from <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Testimony,</hi> are two: and both taken from two diſtinct <hi>vſes</hi> of Baptiſme, which now follow in order.</p>

I alleadged the place before: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſpeakes ſo fully to this purpoſe, I will repeat the ſame againe. This Author hauing declared himſelfe for the efficacy of baptiſme, doth with al giue vs to vnderſtand that in perſons of yeares faith is ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that without faith they neither receiue the ſeale of iuſtification, nor yet of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, in their baptiſme?

And this he ſpeakes as grounded on this very text, vnleſſe we will ſay that he forgate his text, when he ſpake it; which to impute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, were, in my apprehenſion, a wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him.</p>
               <p>wherefore I conclude this argument thus. If the iudgment of <hi>Caluine, Zanchius; Peter Martyr,</hi> And the <hi>Author of our Engliſh commentary on Titus,</hi> be ſound in expoſition of this ſcripture, it doth proue the ordinary communication of the ſpirit of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well to infants elect; as to perſons of yeares that actually beleeue; which is the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7446:59"/> ſubſtance of our maine Poſition.</p>
               <p>My third and laſt argument is drawne <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>3</label> from <hi>another vſe of baptiſme;</hi> to wit our <hi>inſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>incorporation into Chriſt.</hi> I frame it thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maior.</hi> That which baptizeth elect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants into the death of Chriſt, &amp; initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally incorporateth them into the true myſticall body of Chriſt, in their baptiſme; muſt needs be, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, communicated to them, in that ordinance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Minor.</hi> But it is the ſpirit of Chriſt that thus doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſ:</hi> Therefore the ſpirit of Chriſt, according to the ſcripture, is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily giuen to the elect in Baptiſme</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> is confirmed thus. The elect are baptized into Chriſts death, when they are baptized outwardly and ſacramentally; therefore they muſt needs then receiue that by which this is done.

               <p>This learned man hauing largely confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the blind error of the Anabaptiſts that furiouſly deny the baptiſme of Infants,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7446:62"/> ſhewes alſo that, how ever he admit of ſome preſent efficacy of Baptiſme even in and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; his meaning is not that they doe ordinarily partake of <hi>actuall</hi> Regeneration in that Ordinance, vnleſſe they bee ſuch as die in their infancy. For thus hee explicates himſelfe in this particular. <hi>Whom God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth to elect, if after they haue receaued the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſme they dye before they come to yeares, them he doth renew by the power of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by vs incomprehenſible, as it ſeemeth best vnto himſelfe.

               <p>If it bee anſwered, that all this may bee granted, and yet the maine point ſtill denied: becauſe the ſpirit may be giuen to the elect, not at the moment of baptiſme, but at their effectuall calling by the <hi>Word:</hi> I reply; then, betweene the time of Baptiſme and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all calling outwardly by the word, baptiſme

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7446:64"/> ordinarily, in Baptiſme:) becauſe by their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion it is a ſeale of ſome thing abſent that is to be expected in reverſion only. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all preſent exhibition and collation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grace in the moment of Baptiſme, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſts inſtitution; and ſo they doe not make it a ſigne <hi>ſignifying</hi> but rather <hi>prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticating</hi> only ſome future effect: which is a new kind of Divinity, that, ſo farre as I am able to iudge, deſtroyes the nature of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, by denying to it both the cheefe part of it, viz: the inward grace thereby ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and together with the ſigne exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and conferred on thoſe that truly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be within the couenant; as alſo the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and efficacy of the word of inſtitution which makes the vnion betweene the ſigne and the thing ſignified; &amp; laſtly this ſpoiles elect infants of the inward ſeale; to wit, the ſpirit of Chriſt which incorporates them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt as members of his body.

                  </label> to me after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Some places haue beene alleadged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to proue, that in baptiſme the ſpirit is giuen to the faithfull: but yet wee heare not of one text that ſaith directly and expreſlly that <hi>elect infants,</hi> doe, <hi>then,</hi> receiue the ſpirit?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwere That when any of you will ſhew me any expreſſe text of ſcripture that in direct termes mentions the baptizing of infants, I will alſo ſhew you an expreſſe Text to proue their reception of the ſpirit in Baptiſme. But if you cannot doe the one (nor is it much materiall, ſo long as there is ſuch ſolid ground in the ſcriptures, and ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted arguments may be thence drawne
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7446:65"/> to proue the lawfulneſſe and neceſſary vſe of Paedobaptiſme;) what equity is it to require of me the other? How is it poſſible to ſhew an expreſſe text prouing that infants doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the ſpirit in Baptiſme, when no text is found that mentions their baptiſme. If in the iudgement of all the Churches of Chriſt, it be ſufficient (as indeed it is) to confute all the Anabaptiſts in the world, that infants are within the couenant, &amp; therefore ought not to be debarred of the ſeale of it, no more then infants of old were debarred of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion by reaſon of their inability and incapacity to vnderſtand that miſtery; that to them belongs the kingdome of heauen, and therefore the admittance into it muſt be yeelded them; that they are a part of Chriſts Church, yea of his body; laſtly, that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they haue not actuall faith, yet, they haue the ſpirit of faith to apply vnto them the grace of baptiſme, if God ſo pleaſe: and therefore in all theſe reſpects they may be baptized, notwithſtanding that no Text of ſcripture enioyne it in ſo many words: Then this alſo ought to ſatiſfie all ingenuous and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7446:66"/> moderate men, that by like ſound and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequences I haue from the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures made good this point in hand. The places alleadged I haue ſeriouſly weighed, and found them all cleare for the proofe of my concluſion. Nor haue I beene mine owne iudge, or expounded them out of mine own head, but taken ſuch expoſitions as the moſt Learned Iudicious, Reuerend, and eminent Diuines of this laſt age, as well as others of leſſe note had ſet vpon them, long before I medled with them: leaſt any man ſhould ſay, that I take vpon me to coine expoſitions of mine owne, that might looke fauourably vpon that which is taken to be mine owne cauſe.</p>
               <p>One thing more remaines that in a word muſt be diſpatched. There are ſome I know, will like well enough the allegations of Scripture brought to proue that the <hi>Elect,</hi> that <hi>all the elect</hi> doe receiue the ſpirit in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: but with all they finde fault at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining of thoſe ſcriptures to the <hi>Elect only:</hi> for they will haue it thus, that the ſcriptures are cleare to proue, that <hi>all</hi> that are baptized,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7446:66"/> doe receiue the ſpirit in Baptiſme, as well as the Elect.</p>
               <p>To this I breefly ſay thus much: The ſcriptures doe not warrant any ſuch extent of baptiſmall grace; but plainly teach the contrary. For What doe theſe men make of that place, in Rom. 8.30. <hi>Whom be did predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them he alſo called, and whom he called, them he alſo iuſtified, and whom he iuſtified, them he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo glorified?</hi> The Apoſtle reſtraines iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and effectuall calling to thoſe that are predeſtinated, to what? to <hi>Grace</hi> only? No; to <hi>glory,</hi> ſaith the Text expreſly.</p>
               <p>The ground of theſe mens miſtake is this, that they thinke the efficacy of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme depends ſo certainly and vniuerſally vpon the <hi>Jnſtitution,</hi> that where there is no wilfull actuall oppoſition in the party bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed he cannot miſſe of the effect; to wit, the ſpirit of grace. But they muſt know that howeuer by vertue of the <hi>inſtitution</hi> we may aſſure our ſelues that the elect partake of the inward grace yet it is not the inſtitution alone, but Gods<note n="*" place="margin">See after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in cap. 6. &amp; 7, the iudgments of <hi>Caluine, Iunius</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>It is true the Fathers except none, yet this proues not that therefore they held that none are exempted by God: nay they often declare the contrary.

Nor doth he make <hi>reluctation</hi> in Simon Magus to be the reaſon why he was not baptized into Chriſt; but <hi>his not hauing of the spirit:</hi> and this is as much in effect, as if he had ſaid, he was not baptized into Chriſt, becauſe he was not in the number of Gods ſonnes by election: for the ſcripture aſſignes this as the reaſon why ſome doe partake of the ſpirit; <hi>becauſe they are ſonnes</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 4.6,</note>. The rule of oppoſition therefore, muſt needs make the contrary true: no ſon no ſpirit: <hi>no ſpirit, none of Chriſts</hi>

               <p>And thus out of the firſt Father of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ſchoolemen that euer reduced the body of Diuinity into a method out of the Fathers, you haue a confeſſion that S <hi>Augustine</hi> was
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7446:77"/> clearely of this iudgement, that <hi>only the elect doe receiue the spirit, &amp; grace in baptiſme;</hi> which therefore we haue reaſon to beleeue to be alſo the iudgment of all the Fathers that liued in his age or before him; vnleſſe we will make him a priuate opinioniſt that diſſenteth from the reſt, which were a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhift, with palpable iniury offered to ſo eminent a Lamp in Gods Church, who hath on his ſide <hi>Chryſostome</hi> &amp; <hi>Hierome,</hi> that for ſubſtance ſpeake as much as he doth; which is enough to acquit him of the ſtaine of a priuate opinion, and ſufficient to ſtop the mouthes of all gainſayers, that would faine ſhake out this arrow ſhott out of his bow into the ſides of that error touching the <hi>equall efficacy</hi> of baptiſme vpon all that are partakers of the outward Element; an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity not hatcht in the Church by the ſpirit of error, till after <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> was dead &amp; rotten.</p>
               <p>It may not be denyed that the Fathers in many paſſages ſpeak not ſo diſtinctly &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, as the groſſe miſtakes of after ages would haue required; yet their exceſſiue
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7446:77"/> ſpeeches and flowres of Rhetorique muſt not be ſo farre vrged, as to weaken their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in what they tooke vpon them to ſpeake poſitiuely, properly, and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, according to the Scriptures. When no Aduerſary as yet appeared to abuſe their ſpeeches to a wrong ſenſe; they ſpake more ſecurely and freely, not giuing ſuch exact bounds to their words, as otherwiſe they would haue done. If they found any that would preſume vpon ſaluation, becauſe they had beene outwardly baptized; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were Hereticks, Hypocrites, or lewd liuers, <hi>Chryſostome</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> (as we haue ſeene) begin then to reſtraine the ſauing grace of Baptiſme only to ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and liue as they ought. And if any thinke that <hi>Election</hi> makes no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and man, but that ſuch as are not elected, as well as the elect, may bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of <hi>Baptiſmal grace</hi> equally; S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> will take off that opinion with proteſtation, that <hi>the Sacraments doe not effect what they ſignifie, but only vpon the elect:</hi> and this, <hi>Lombard</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe will confeſſe to bee true, of the efficacy
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7446:78"/> of baptiſme vnto ſaluation. When therefore we meet with any of the Ancients that doe not thus limit their aſſertions, we muſt yet conceaue them to be of the ſame mind with S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in this point; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues (as in the former Chapter hath beene declared) doe ſo bound the ſame, from which we ought not to conceaue that thoſe ſounder Fathers would diſſent, foraſmuch as thoſe three Worthies before alleaged (who are better Expoſitors of the mindes of the reſt of their Brethren that liued with them or before them, then any peruerſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt or Arminian either is, or can be,) haue ſo fully and perſpicuouſly declared themſelues agreeable therevnto.

               <p>Thus haue we the <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of nine ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Churches of cheefeſt note beyond the ſeas, profeſſing and publiſhing as much as thoſe eight Fathers of old, and as our owne Church at home, touching the efficacy of Baptiſme of elect infants; or, if you will, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely of all infants ſuppoſed to be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and indeed within the election and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of grace.</p>
               <p>Some, haply, will be medling here againe, and ſay that all theſe confeſſions doe not ſet ſuch a reſtraint vpon the efficacy of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, as our preſent poſition doth, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it indifferently vnto all. But to ſuch I muſt giue the ſame anſwere that I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe the obiection is the ſame and becauſe alſo it is ſet vpon the ſame ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy foundation: viz. that the <hi>Confeſſions</hi> are indefinite, ſo as none are excluded from the grace of the ſacrament, that are partakers of the outward waſhing. The forme of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which the churches vſe is indefinite, and it is neceſſary it ſhould be ſo, becauſe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7446:83"/> they ſpeake of baptiſme conſidered in the nature of it when it is applied to thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the couenant, to all which the grace of baptiſme is ordinarily giuen: yet well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all are not indeed within the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, although borne of parents that are members of the viſible Church; they doe not ſay <hi>vniuerſally</hi> that <hi>all infants are partakers of the grace of baptiſme;</hi> but <hi>indefinitely,</hi> that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are partakers of it.</hi> Now, although oft times an indefinite propoſition <hi>in materia neceſſaria,</hi> be equiualent to an vniuerſall: yet it is not alwaies ſo, (as, hath beene former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſh wed) when ſome circumſtance doth occurre that may varie the condition of the partie to whom it is applied As for example, to ſay that perſons ſo &amp; ſo educated in their youth doe proue wiſe and able men for ſuch or ſuch an imployment, makes the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be taken as <hi>generally</hi> true, by reaſon of the ſufficiency of the meanes of their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: yet becauſe there may be, and oft is, ſome inward impediment or incapacity in ſome particulars, that propoſition is by no wiſe men beleeued to be meant as, <hi>vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally</hi>

                  <hi>they are not all Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el which are of Iſrael?</hi> What then? Why, this. The Apoſtle looking vpon the powerfull meanes of begetting the Galathians vnto God, <hi>viz</hi> the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering their outward ſubmiſſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity thereunto, he profeſſeth of them in the Lump, <hi>ye are all the Children of God, &amp;c.</hi> Howbeit no man will take him otherwiſe then this; <hi>yee are all his children if yee hee indeed inwardly, what yee ſeeme outwardly to mee, that am willing thus to hope and ſpeake of you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner then, muſt the Churches be vnderſtood, if they ſhould deliuer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7446:84"/> in vniverſall termes; for aſmuch as all are not partakers of the ſpirit and bloud of Chriſt, that are partakers of the outward La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of regeneration, as ſome of the Fathers haue ſoundly taught vs, in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Becauſe in the ſacrament, by virtue of Chriſts inſtitution, ordinarily, grace is giuen to all that are by election capable of it; and it being knowne to none who they be that are not elected, it is more apt and proper to ſpeake indefinitly, rather then reſtrictiuely, in publique Confeſſions of Churches, that ſo all may with more care and reuerence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Ordinance of Chriſt, and expect that in it, which how euer it be not of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty vniuerſally communicated to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, yet is not denied to this, or that, or any particular, preſented vnto baptiſme, for ought any mortall man can iudge, or may take liberty to preſume of any one in particular, howeuer in the generall he may ſet it downe for a concluſion of truth, that there are ſome which goe without it.</p>
               <p>If yet I ſhould be further preſſed, that at leaſt all the <hi>Lutherans</hi> doe expreſly and ſtifly
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7446:84"/> declare themſelues to beleeue that all infants doe certainely receiue the inward grace of baptiſme, ſo as to be indeed regenerated in the very inſtant of the adminiſtration? To this I anſwere, that it is perhaps true of ſome particular men among them, that, as all men who profeſſe themſelues ſtiffe followers of ſuch or ſuch a maſter, doe vſually in tract of time and through heat of diſputation, goe further then their maſter, or then thoſe more moderate men that in former times did adde here vnto him, as they now doe; ſo theſe (who therefore, for ſome errors which they vniuſtly father vpon that Worthy, are termed <hi>pſeudo Lutherans</hi>) going further then euer <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Whom God vouchſafeth to elect, if after they haue receiued the ſigne of regeneration, they dye before they come to yeares, them he doth renew by the power of his ſpirit, by vs incomprehenſible, as it ſeemeth best vnto himſelfe. But if it ſo fall out that they liue to yeares of diſcretion, whereby they may be inſtructed concerning the truth of their baptiſme, they are then thereby the more prouoked to the study of newneſſe of life, the pledge and badg whereof they then come to learne that they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with from their very infancy, whereby they ought more ſeriouſly to meditate vpon the ſame all the daies of their life. And hither is to be referred that which Paul teacheth in thoſe two distinct pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces touching our buriall with Chriſt by Baptiſme,</hi> (Rom 6 4. Col. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.12.) <hi>For thereby the Apoſtle meant not to ſhew that it is neceſſary for him that is to be baptized, to be thus buried with Chriſt,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7446:90"/> beforehand; but, what ſimply baptiſme doth effect in and vpon them that are now baptized, that ſo no crackt braines ſhould contend that this doth goe before baptiſme. After the ſame manner Moſes &amp; the Prophets admoniſhed the people what was the meaning of circumciſion; with which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their very infants were alſo ſigned. This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiualent to that which alſo the Apostle writeth to the Galathians, that when they were baptized, they put on Chriſt. Why ſpeakes he ſo? Namely, that they might now liue vnto Christ, which before that time, they had not done. And although in perſons of ripe age the receiuing of the ſacrament ought to follow the vnderſtanding of the myſtery; yet infants are to be accounted of another ranck and number, as ſhall be preſently declared, &amp;c.</hi> By all this then it is manifeſt that <hi>Caluines</hi> iudgment was for the reception of the ſpirit in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, in the ordinary courſe thereof, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the inſtance he giues of the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> who receiued his firſt ſanctification in his mothers womb. His meaning was not to ſhew <hi>when</hi> an infant receiues the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as if he vſually receiued it in the womb, or out of baptiſme; but only to proue a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7446:91"/> that an infant may receiue the ſpirit in baptiſme notwithſtanding his infancy, becauſe hee may partake of it in the very womb.</p>
               <p>Well; yet when you haue all done, <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine</hi> ſpeakes this in ſome ſpeciall caſes only; as namely in the caſe of <hi>elect infants dying in infancy,</hi> as the place laſt cited may declare? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is very true that <hi>Caluine</hi> ſpeakes not of all that are outwardly baptized; no more doe I.

                  <hi>Baptiſme ſaues none of yeares, but beleeuers. Saluation indeed is offered in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme vnto all; but thoſe of yeares receiue it not, but by faith, and infants, by the ſecret operation of the holy Ghoſt, by which they are alſo ſanctified

Nor is this inſtrument of baptiſme leſſe effectuall vnto all theſe vſes in the elect, whom God hath reſolued to regenerate, than is any remedy, how effectuall ſoeuer, by a naturall energy, to giue health to a body that is most capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch remedy, when it is applied thereunto. For on Gods word the effect of each thing depends.

                  <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is a ſacred action of God waſhing thoſe that be he his owne, inwardly, with the waſhing of the ſpirit; outwardly with the waſhing of water.</hi> Mat 3.

Theſe two therefore, the water, and the ſpirit, the waſhing of water, and the waſhing of the ſpirit, are relatiues, And the relation it ſelfe is that application or vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe one to another according to the nature of relatiues, which constitutes the forme of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherefore as a man in humane actions doth, with his ſoule and body produce both an inward and an outward action in one and the ſame opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which as the ſoule is ſaid to be the forme of the body, ſo is the inward action, after a ſort; the formall; and the externall, the materiall part of the action: euen ſo after the ſame manner God, by his ſpirit and by water, doth performe both an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and an externall action, in one and the

               <p>And whereas <hi>M.

B. Jewel,</hi> to that word <hi>faith,</hi> giues this note in the margent; <hi>This tale is needleſſe, and out of ſeaſon.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, in the baptiſme of infants, we require not faith, but rely only on Gods promiſe. For ſo, more at large, in his anſwere to <hi>Harding,</hi> Hee explicates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Firſt, he granteth it as a truth, <hi>that the ſacrament dependeth, neither of the miniſter, nor of the receiuer, nor of any other: for though they be all the children of ſinne, yet is baptiſme the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of remiſſion of ſinne.</hi> The place he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth out of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> ſpeakes his minde plainly, that, he depends vpon Chriſt himſelfe for the efficacy of baptiſme, and not vpon the <hi>faith</hi> of the receiuer, if he be an infant, of which only the queſtion betwene
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7446:106"/> Him and <hi>Harding</hi> was (by <hi>Harding</hi> himſelfe) put vp, who chargeth the Proteſtants with denying the preſent efficacy of baptiſme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Remiſſion of ſinnes vpon infants, for want of actuall faith.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, becauſe the Aduerſary is ſo brag and confident that the Fathers ſtood not vpon <hi>faith</hi> in the baptizing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, the Biſhop is pleaſed a little to take downe his pride, and to diſcouer his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the Fathers, and ſhewes out of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> that to the intent Baptiſme might be effectuall vnto infants, they thought it requiſite that the faith of their parents ſhould then be imployed on their behalfe, and be imputed to them. But yet for his owne part he profeſſeth his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from that opinion, although, it might be further backed out of <hi>Iuſtine Martyr;</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierome. For thus they write,</hi> ſaith he: <hi>How truly, I will not ſay. But their words be plaine. The Prophet Habbacuck</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iustus ex fide ſuâ vivet, the iuſt man ſhall liue (not by the faith of his parents but) by his owne faith.</hi> Then he approueth a ſpeech of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> more
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7446:106"/> conſonant to the truth, affirming that<note n="g" place="margin">Habent fidem propter fidei ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum. Epiſt. <hi>23.</hi> ad Bonif.</note> 
                  <hi>Infants haue faith of their owne, becauſe they haue baptiſme which is the ſacrament of faith:</hi> for he ſaith; <hi>quemadmodum ſacramentum corporis Christi, ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quendam modum, corpus Chriſti est, ita ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum fidei fides eſt. As the ſacrament of Christs body</hi> (not verily and indeed, but) <hi>after a certaine manner of ſpeech, is Christs body: ſo baptiſme is faith, becauſe it is the ſacrament of faith. Therefore</hi> ſaith <hi>Iewel Cardinall Caietane is worthily blamed by Catharinus, in that he ſaith, An infant for that hee wanteth inſtruction in faith, therefore hath not perfect baptiſme.</hi> Out of all which I can picke no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Engliſh but this: There is no neceſſity that we ſhould holde a neceſſity of faith in infants: yet, if they haue any, it is but impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, it is that, not which they brought with them to the ſacrament; but that which they are reputed to receiue in the ſacrament it ſelfe. And this, in effect, is the very doctrine of<note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Inſtit. lib:</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. <hi>ſect.</hi> 21. compared with other paſſages in the ſame chapter.</note> 
                  <hi>Caluine,</hi> ſet forth at large in the former chapter: <hi>viz.</hi> that it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite alwaies that a Chriſtian ſhould bring grace vnto baptiſme, to make him capable of the grace of baptiſme; but he muſt come to baptiſme that there he may receiue it, if
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7446:107"/> he be not of yeares; as he that is of yeares, receiues a confirmation of that which was wrought in him before. And ſo much this ſame Biſhop in his <hi>Reply to M. Hardings Anſwer. Art.</hi> 1. <hi>Div.</hi> 13. (of which place wee ſhall perhaps haue fitter occaſion afterwards to ſpeake) in effect declareth alſo.</p>
               <p>For the preſent, you ſee, that what euer becomes of the faith of infants, he ioynes with <hi>Catharinus</hi> in condemning of <hi>Caietane</hi> denying <hi>infants to be perfectly baptized for want of instruction in faith.</hi> Then, he expreſſeth that, as the Antient Fathers did, ſo doth he hold baptiſme to be efficacious; yet not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward element, but the ſpirit of Chriſt doth the deed when it is effected. In breefe, he denyes not the thing to be conferred even on <hi>infants,</hi> but only the manner which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> contend for. They ſay that the blood and ſpirit of Chriſt is in the very out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward clement, by the conſecration of the Preiſt, as the virtue of healing is naturall in a medicine, and that <hi>ex opere operato</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the bare outward adminiſtration of that ſacrament every one partakes certainly
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7446:107"/> and indeed of the inward grace. This, The founder Fathers diſclaimed, as wee haue proued at large, &amp; this B. <hi>Iewel</hi> makes good out of them, againſt his aduerſary, that the inward grace comes from God immediatly, and not from the water, or outward act of the miniſter In ſumme, he thus ſhuts vp the whole matter,<note n="i" place="margin">Defence of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol pag. <hi>219.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>As for that M. Harding here toucheth as an error defended by certain, I know not by whome, that haptiſme giueth not full remiſsion of ſinnes, he may command it home againe to Lovaine amongſt his fellowes, and ioyne it with other of his and their vanities. For it is no part nor portion of our doctrine. Wee confeſſe and haue euermore taught that in the ſacrament of Baptiſme, by the death and blood of Chriſt is giuen remiſſion of all manner ſinnes: and that not in halfe, or in part, or by way of imagination, or by fancy, but full, whole, &amp; perfect of all together: ſo that now, as Saint Paul ſaith, there is no condemnation to them that be in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope no man duly conſidering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy betweene him and <hi>Harding,</hi> will haue the face to ſay that the Biſhop ſpeakes not this of the preſent efficacy of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7446:108"/> baptiſme, but of that which at actuall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is to be expected. For the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Harding</hi> complaines is this that, wee deny the preſent efficacy of baptiſme, and make it <hi>only a ſigne, or at beſt but a ſeale</hi> to confirme future grace, vntill wee haue attained actuall faith. And the anſwere what it is, you now ſee: <hi>viz.</hi> that wee allow and teach that in baptiſme is giuen full remiſſion of all ſinnes; which if the Biſhop ſhould not meane of the <hi>preſent</hi> effect of baptiſme, his aduerſary might iuſtly complaine for want of anſwer to his vniuſt complaint.</p>
               <p>Thus much then we haue gained out of this Iudicious <hi>Father,</hi> that, at leaſt, remiſſion of ſinnes is ordinarily communicated to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, in their baptiſme, when it is adminiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And, if remiſſion of ſinnes be then gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, it muſt needs be yeelded further, that he held that, the ſpirit of God is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, <hi>then</hi> alſo, vnto infants, for the apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that benefit vnto them. Therefore in the very ſame place,<note n="k" place="margin">Defence Apol. pag <hi>218.</hi>
                  </note> he voucheth a paſſage of <hi>Cyprian</hi>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7446:108"/> giuen by baptiſme or by any other ſacraments, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of the Holy Ghost: and to the ſame Holy Ghost only the priuiledge of this worke doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine. The ſolemnity of the words, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Gods holy name, and the outward ſignes appointed to the miniſtry of the Preiſts by the Apoſtolicall inſtitutions, worke the viſible out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſacrament, but touching the ſubſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (which is the remiſſion of ſinnes) it is the holy Ghoſt that worketh it.

               <p>If any paſſionate oppoſite ſhould be ſo farre tranſported, as to obiect; that all that haue beene hitherto ſpoken out of <hi>Biſhop Iewel,</hi> tends only to proue that <hi>Remiſſion of ſinne</hi> is giuen to infants in Baptiſme, which is another thing from the preſent point of <hi>Regeneration:</hi> therefore all this is as much as nothing to the purpoſe?</p>
               <p>I anſwere, firſt, that this obiection is ſo ſilly that it deſerues no anſwere; for what Author euer taught plenary Remiſſion of all
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7446:109"/> ſinnes to be giuen to him, that doth not in ſome meaſure partake of the ſpirit vnto ſanctification? was it euer knowne that theſe two were ſeparated? Why then is it required that our author ſhould in expreſſe termes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme both; or elſe, be denyed to allow of both, although he expreſly avouch it of the one of them He had no occaſion to ſpeake directly touching <hi>Regeneration,</hi> nor could he well doe it, without digreſſion. For the Queſtion betweene him and his Antagoniſt was only touching the preſent efficacy of Baptiſme vnto <hi>Remiſſion of ſinne:</hi> if therefore he ſhould haue fallen vpon the other, hee ſhould idly haue runne out of his way, and fallen vpon another controuerſy not ſo much as named by the Aduerſe party.</p>

His words are theſe: <hi>And as the children of the faithfull by right ought to be baptized: ſo ſuch others alſo as were borne of vnbeleeuing parents, and were ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens from the common wealth of Iſrael, and were ſtrangers from the couenant of promiſe, and had no
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7446:110"/> hope, if they acknowledge the error in which they liued, and ſeeke the forgiueneſſe of their former ſins, may well receiue this ſacrament of their regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So, when they which heard Peter, were prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their hearts, and ſaid to Peter and the other Apoſtles: Men and brethren what ſhall we doe, Peter</hi> ſaid vnto them. <hi>Amend your liues, and be baptized euery one of you in the name of Ieſus Chriſt for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of ſins. They were buried with Chriſt by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme into his death, &amp; made partakers of his blood, and continued in the Apoſtles Doctrine and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> Then he goes on with his diſcourſe of <hi>theſe,</hi> in the words before cited out of the 266 page. Now in all this there is not one word of infants, of whom he had ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and ſo that paſſage cannot be taken as a deny all of the efficacy of Baptiſme in any without faith, ſaue only in perſons of years. And if this were not thus to be vnderſtood, he ſhould directly contradict all that he had before ſpoken of the regeneration of infants, in whom there is no actuall faith, by his owne confeſſion, in his <hi>defence</hi> againſt <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as I haue ſhewed before: And to make this yet more cleare that, he did certainly
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7446:111"/> beleeue that infants in baptiſme receiued ſome <hi>principle of regeneration,</hi> although not <hi>actuall renovation</hi> of the whole man, ſee what he ſaith afterwards in the ſame <hi>Treatiſe of the ſacraments,</hi> touching the ſtate of infants baptized, and of the care of parents in their education.<note n="n" place="margin">Page. 282.</note>

You haue brought them to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of baptiſme to receiue the marke of Chriſt: bring them vp in knowledge, and watch ouer them that they be not lost. So ſhall they be confirmed and will keepe the promiſe they haue made, &amp; will grow vp vnto perfect age in Chriſt.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>they are borne anew;</hi> and yet bids parents be carefull that <hi>they may be begotten vnto God:</hi> Therefore he well diſcerned the diſtinction of <hi>initiall</hi> and <hi>actuall</hi> regeneration.

                  <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> a man of moſt profound iudgment, ſaith, <hi>he dares not embrace their opinion, that aſcribe faith to infants: not but that God can if he will, infuſe faith into them, and enable them to reaſon
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7446:117"/> before the ordinary time; &amp; cauſe, that though they doe neither vnderſtand, nor know the things which are to be beleeued, notwithſtanding the spirit, in them, may apprehend and giue conſent to thoſe things, for them; as the ſpirit is ſaid to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for vs vnto God, euen when we know not what to pray for, as wee ought; and then God, who knowes the minde of the ſpirit, heareth the ſame: Howbeit ſeeing the. Scriptures doe not ſay that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants doe beleeue, nor doth this ſeeme neceſſary to them vnto ſaluation, he thinkes it ſufficient that we ſay that they who are ſaued, (for as much as they are part of Gods peculiar by Predeſtination and election;) are endewed with the Holy Ghoſt, who is the roote of faith, hope, charity, and all other virtues which afterward he produceth and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Gods children, when they come to yeares.</hi> Thus farre he voucheth the words of <hi>Peter Martyr:</hi> then he goes on in his owne words thus to illuſtrate the ſame; <hi>They may therefore be called faithfull, or beleeuers, as they may be ſaid to be reaſonable creatures. For although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants cannot rationally diſcourſe, yet they haue a ſoule, whereby, when they come to ſome yeares, they may be able to diſcourſe. So that, they are called
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7446:118"/> reaſonable creatures, not becauſe they haue preſent vſe of their reaſonable faculty, but by reaſon of the principle of reaſon in them; to witt, the reaſonable ſoule which is capable of all arts and ſciences. Therefore (we ſay) expreſſe faith is required in all of yeares, but in infants, only faith begun or in his first principle or roote, namely the</hi> HOLY GHOST <hi>with which they are endewed, and from whom faith and other graces, in due time, doe, flow or iſſue forth. For infants are purged by the spirit, ſeeing they are in the Church, and of the Church. Chriſt ſanctified his Church, purging it in the Lauer of water through the word. If then they belong to the Church, they are adorned with the ſpirit. if they be receiued vp into heauen, they are then purged by the spirit.</hi>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7446:126"/> are to be expounded. For, the words are ſpoken only of the worke of the word in &amp; vpon aged perſons called either from Iuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme, or Gentiliſme, by the preaching of the Goſpell; who, as <hi>Lidia;</hi> (Act. 16.14) had their hearts opened by the ſpirit, to vnderſtand and receiue the things, preached vnto them, and ſo were begotten anew vnto God: that is, made new men in Chriſt, to performe new obedience actually vnto God, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their former courſe in the ſtate of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature.</p>
               <p>In this actuall conuerſion and renouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſpirit is the efficient cauſe; and the word an inſtrument only, that he pleaſeth to make vſe of; not, as if hee could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch this worke without it: but this is that which he hath ſanctified, and commanded vs to attend vpon, ſo ſoone as wee are able, by acceſſion of yeares, to vnderſtand the vſe of it, for conuerſion in the ordinary courſe thereof.

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7446:126"/> were actually renewed by the Word, therefore, it is falſe that elect infants doe receiue the spirit in baptiſme for their initiation into Chriſt, and as the ſoule and principle of after actuall renovation by the word?</hi> This is all the ſtrength that this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection hath in it, when they haue impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it to the vtmoſt.

                  <hi>Infants cannot be thought new men, becauſe they be not regenerated by the Word; Calvin</hi> makes this anſwere: <hi>I haue ſaid often, and I now repeat it, that, the Word is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible ſeed of regeneration vnto vs; provided that we be capable of it: but where infancy makes vncapable of instruction by that meanes, God doth retaine his courſe of working ſome degrees of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> without it. If it be replyed; <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeakes what may be; and what, in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary caſes, ſometimes happens; but not what <hi>is vſually</hi> done in the baptiſme of the Elect? I reioine, That, if <hi>Calvine</hi> meant only thus much, his Anſwere could not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Anabaptiſts, who therefore denie baptiſme to infants, becauſe they are not <hi>then</hi>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:7446:128"/> capable of regeneration and faith: and hee on the contrary, ſaith they be capable of ſome regeneration, and therefore ought to be baptized. If he meant not baptiſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, how can their poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation be a warrant for baptiſme, ſeeing they haue, or may haue that, without bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. Laſtly, if it were not ordinary with God to regenerate elect infants in baptiſme, his anſwere would fall ſhort too. <q>For they might iuſtly reply, that an ordinary practiſe of baptizing all infants is not to bee war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted from ſome extraordinary caſes. If you confeſſe that it is not ordinary that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect infants are regenerated in baptiſme; what reaſon haue you to tie all men to that, wherein you cannot promiſe them the grace that is repreſented thereby, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to all that vſe it with vnderſtanding and faith.</q> This, and much more might be vnanſwerable returned vpon <hi>Calvine,</hi> by <hi>Servetus</hi> and his Clients; if they had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him to deny Initiall Regeneration of elect infants, to be ordinarily communicated to them in Baptiſme. I conclude therefore,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:7446:128"/> with iudicious <hi>Calvine:</hi> However it be true, which the Scriptures ſpeake of the actuall regeneration of perſons of yeares; that they are regenerated by the Word; yet Elect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants may be, and are, for ought appeares in either of the places of ſcripture obiected to the contrary, partakers of <hi>Initiall</hi> Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the Spirit, in their Baptiſme: and ſo this Obiection doth our Poſition no harme.</p>

               <p>Touching the diſtinction of <hi>Initial</hi> and <hi>Actual</hi> Regeneration, I haue ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before, in my <hi>ſecond Chapter,</hi> in what ſenſe I vſe it. I will therefore forbeare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what there I haue written. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may view it at his pleaſure. If any man demande expreſſe Scriptures for the very termes, he will ſoone declare of what Spirit he is. But if by ſufficient conſequence the diſtinction be not clearely deduced thence, he ſhall then haue cauſe to complaine. Let him view the foundation on which it is built, and afterwards tell me his minde, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnſatisfied. In the meane time I ſhal only adde thus much: that by <hi>Initial,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall</hi> Regeneration, I doe not meane to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate two ſeverall <hi>kindes</hi> of ſpirituall life; for which, I acknowledge, there is no footing in Scripture: but I vnderſtand only two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct conſiderations in reſpect of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7446:129"/> of ſpirituall life in the ſame ſubiect, which the places of Scripture before allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Chapt. 2. doe ſufficiently warrant. For, by life, in Scripture, is ſometimes meant the ſoule infuſed as the principle of life: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the very actuall being and enliuening of the ſubiect by that ſoule, making it actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to produce the actions of life. Hence I diſtinguiſh of life into <hi>Initiall,</hi> and <hi>Actuall:</hi> Not as if the Spirit were not actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, or did not actually worke, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually beginne, from the very firſt inſtant, to diſpoſe and prepare the ſoule to future a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall newneſſe of life, by infuſing ſome <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall</hi> and <hi>ſeminall</hi> grace; but my meaning is that, the Spirit doth not at that time, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, ſo plenarily change &amp; renew the whole man, as to worke in him either actuall faith, hope, or loue, &amp;c: or ſo much as the habits of theſe or other particular graces, for the preſent as afterward he doth. Something the ſpirit doth, from his firſt entrance, toward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual regeneration, therefore we cal that firſt worke, <hi>Initiall:</hi> thereby vnderſtanding the firſt diſpoſition to, or degree of actuall rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7446:130"/> But for as much as that firſt worke doth not (for ought we know) extend to a preſent actuall change of the whole man in the ſame manner and degree, that afterwards is wrought in him, at his <hi>effectuall</hi> calling; therefore we call that latter worke, <hi>Actuall Regeneration.</hi>

And yet, as thoſe Counters which ſtand for pence, might as well haue ſtood for pounds, as thoſe that do ſtand for pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, if it had pleaſed him that ſet them to haue ſo diſpoſed them: So men may put words of the ſame value and natiue ſignification, to ſignifie diverſe things, by a liberty iuſtifiable enough in vſe of ſpeech: &amp; yet thoſe words, may without wrong, be vſed by others to ſignifie other things: alwaies provided that when a man vſeth a word in a ſenſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent either from the prime ſignification of it, or from the common acceptation of it, he

And it is one thing to be a Gentile,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:7446:135"/> without the Church, that hath nothing to doe with Chriſt or his ſpirit, till he heares him publiſhed in the preaching of the Goſpell, which is the firſt ordinance of Chriſt that he partakes of: (for firſt, Chriſt is preached vnto him; then, beleeuing, he is to be baptized) and it is another thing to be borne of parents that are viſible members of a ſetled and ſtabliſhed Church, ſo as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo borne is to be held and reputed for one of the faithfull euen from the womb. It is no wonder if the former ſort receiue the ſpirit in the hearing of the word: for, how elſe ſhould they come by it in the ordinary courſe of diſpenſation by meanes?

               <p n="1">1. To the <hi>Maior,</hi> I anſwere by denying the ſequele. For, in the caſe of infants dying in infancy, the ſpirit <hi>can,</hi> and (no doubt) <hi>doth</hi> actually regenerate them, without the word; how elſe ſhould they enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen? In what manner the ſpirit doth regenerate ſuch, is to vs vnknowne. Nor will I take vpon me to determine that which the Scripture is ſilent in. They that deny all actuall regeneration till the word come, without exception of ſuch as dy in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7446:136"/> doe conclude all infants dying before they be able to make vſe of the Word, to be damned.

Thus we ſee in few words that the <hi>Conſequent</hi> of the <hi>Major,</hi> is an idle <hi>non ſequitur;</hi> grounded on a falſe ſuppoſition. For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſay that, actuall Regeneration is not wrought but by the Word, yet we grant not this Vniuerſally of all, but only of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of yeares.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To the <hi>Minor</hi> I anſwere thus,</p>
               <p n="1">1 I deny that the Apoſtle, in that place, doth ſpeake of <hi>Regeneration wrought by the Word:</hi> for hee ſpeakes not at all either of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation ſtrictly and formally ſo called; but only of an act which ſuppoſeth regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; nor, of that act, as wrought by the <hi>Word;</hi> but, of an act wrought, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring by what meanes it is wrought: ſo as, for ought appeares in the Text to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it may be wrought in baptiſme, as well as by any other meanes.

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:7446:136"/> and ſay that, baptiſme hath ſuch efficacy in it as to enable a Chriſtian to <hi>make anſwer vnto God,</hi> becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> (although not the outward waſhing yet the inward Grace) <hi>ſaueth:</hi> as others may vrge it againſt mee, by inferring thence that, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme cannot ſaue without the VVord.

See <hi>page</hi> 44. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>wee cannot iustly obiect againſt Gods worke in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but doe beleeue that our infants are reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, and are borne not bruit beaſts but men; though actually they can manifest no reaſon or vnderſtanding no more then beaſts (yea a young lamb knoweth and diſcerneth his damme ſooner, then an infant knoweth his mother) then neither can we iuſtly obiect, againſt Gods work in grace, but are to beleeue that our infants are ſanctified Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp;c.</hi> And againe <hi>page</hi> 45. anſwering that Cauill of theirs, that if infants haue any grace, it would appeare by the acts and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it; he ſaith thus: <hi>They reaſon ignorantly and perverſly not only againſt the light of Gods word, but of nature. As if ſome bruitiſh perſon ſhould plead thus. A man is a liuing creature that hath a reaſonable ſoule; and the proper affections of a man, as he is a man, are the faculty of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, of thinking, capableneſſe of learning, of remembring, reaſoning, iudging, and diſcerning true and falſe, good and euill, &amp;c. of willing, of nilling, of speaking, of numbring, &amp;c. Now let them which affirme Jnfants are borne men, as Christ doth Ioh:</hi> 16.21) <hi>proue that infants doe vnderſtand, thinke,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7446:143"/> remember, iudg, diſcerne good &amp; euill, approue, will, ſpeake, &amp;c. or elſe they ſay nothing. Were not ſuch a disputer worthy to be laughed &amp; hiſſed at, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the actuall vſe &amp; manifeſtation of humane affections &amp; faculties in infants, which are in them but potentially and in the ſeede &amp; beginning: &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot declare theſe things by their workes, therefore he denyeth them to be of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of man kind, or borne men into the world, or that they haue the faculties of men in them any manner of way? Euen ſuch is the argumentation of theſe erroneous ſpirits againſt the truth of religion.</hi> Thus farre he.</p>
               <p>By this little, ſo much is gotten that, if all the diuines, who haue profeſſedly entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the particular conſideration of this point, be not out, and, if the Anabaptiſts be not in the right, <hi>there is a poſſibility for the ſpirit to be in an infant, and yet not preſently manifeſt his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence by any worke of grace actually, ſo as it may be ſeene and knowne either by the infant himſelfe, or by the beholders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Wherefore in the next place I ſay, that ſince the ſpirit may be in an infant, and yet not worke actuall faith and regeneration,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:7446:143"/> therefore the conſequent of this propoſition that concludes <hi>the spirit to be idle if hee worke not ſuch grace,</hi> muſt needs bee falſe alſo.

Hath hee no worke but one, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant? Doe we knowe all the workes of God? Or ſhall wee deny all, that wee knowe not? This is a bold ſpeech to ſay, either the ſpirit muſt worke this or that particular worke in an infant, which hee vſually worketh in all perſons of yeares where he pleaſeth to dwel, or elſe he is idle.

Nor is it impoſſible that even actuall grace ſhould ly hidden, ſo as neither others, nor the party himſelfe in whom that grace is, can diſcerne the ſame at all times, as after ſhall be declared.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That I never affirmed any actuall change of the ſoule, in the baptiſme of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants that afterwards liue to yeares of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; no, nor ſo much as any particular habits of particular graces, anſwerable vnto thoſe that are vſually wrought in others at the time of their actuall Converſion.

                  <hi>Whitaker</hi>) further ſpeaketh; and as <hi>Calvin</hi> had done, before him. This Principle of Grace lies hid, as ſeed vnder ground; as wheat vnder chaffe; as fire vnder the aſhes; as the faculty of reaſon ſeemes to lye aſleep, till a child bee growne vp to ſome capacity; and as the ſpirit of God moued vpon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before the ſeverall creatures were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally produced by the word of his power.</p>
               <p>By this wee may diſcerne what anſwere to giue to that <hi>Dilemma,</hi> vrged by ſome to this effect: <hi>viz:</hi> 
                  <q>If the ſpirit bee giuen to an infant in baptiſme, either the infant is aliue or dead; regenerate, or vnregenerate? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate he is not, becauſe there is in him no actuall change: and how can the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:7446:146"/> of regeneration abide in him that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate for a long ſpace after the Spirit firſt entreth into him?</q> To this I ſay that the infant is aliue and regenerate <hi>ſeminally,</hi> &amp; <hi>initially,</hi> in reſpect of the roote and principle of life, but not <hi>actually</hi> in reſpect of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular habits actually wrought in him. An infant may be ſaid to be aliue ſo ſoone as he hath receaued a ſoule; yet he cannot be ſaid to be aliue actually in reſpect of a rationall life till the ſoule bee able to act in a rationall manner. Of ſuch an one wee cannot ſay hee is not aliue, becauſe hee hath in him the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoule the principle of life: nor yet can we ſay that he liues a rationall life, till his reaſonable ſoule doe put it ſelfe forth to rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall actions. Therefore, all men conclude ſuch an infant to be aliue <hi>potentially,</hi> and not <hi>actually,</hi> in reſpect of that <hi>rationall</hi> life where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we now ſpeake.

There are workes as ſtrange in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet no man makes doubt of the truth of them, becauſe he cannot come to ſee how they are done. Therefore we muſt take heed how wee deny the ſpirit to bee in infants to worke in ſuch a ſtrange manner, foraſmuch as the workes of grace, are more ſtrange &amp; admirable then any worke in nature. The wiſe King wiſely giues a check to their curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity that are too bold in prying into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of God, and that by poſing them in a point of Naturall Philoſophy: <hi>As thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not what is the way of the ſpirit, nor how the bones doe grow in the womb of her that is with child: euen ſo thou knoweſt not workes of God who maketh all.

(And how could hee miſtake in that, which the ſpirit himſelfe dictated vnto him.) That part therefore of the obiection which ſaith that, <hi>for many yeares they make oppoſition to all grace, &amp;c.</hi> howeuer it make a great noiſe, and ſeeme to aggrauate the matter much againſt this Poſition: yet hath it in it more ſounde, than weight For, the reaſon why ſo many ſtand out ſo long, is not alwaies or ordinarily from the want of efficacy in their Baptiſme; but, from defect of education. Either they liued not vnder carefull, faithfull, religious parents
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:7446:148"/> that would haue beene diligent with all their might to teach them the feare of the Lord, by all waies and meanes of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and good example, to pray continually for them, to watch ouer them narrowly to keepe them from euill company and euill practiſes; or elſe, they wanted a powerfull Miniſtry; or both. And if they want either, the other, for the moſt part, does little good. Caſt your eyes vpon ſuch as haue not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for either of the former helpes; and tell mee how many you can finde of thoſe that euer come to good at all (in reſpect of the beſt good,) who doe not, ordinarily, take in Religion and grace inſenſibly euen from their tender youth: ſo as many of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, with their beſt ſearch, finde out, directly, the time of their Converſion, although they cannot (when they bee themſelues, free from temptation) deny themſelues to be conuerted. As for ſuch as haue enioyed the former meanes, and yet fly out into debauched courſes, they ſeldome or neuer returne to God at all; and therefore no marveile if they ſtand out long, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:7446:148"/> the helpes afforded; for they, by this, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelues not to be of the number of Gods elect; &amp; ſo, not of thoſe in whom bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is ſo efficacious as here wee affirme it to be. And as for ſuch as ſtand out longeſt, &amp; come in at laſt, you ſhall, ordinarily, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them to be ſuch as had vngodly, or careleſſe parents; or, no ſound and powerfull Miniſtry; or, had the reins too ſoone let looſe vnto them; or were poiſoned with bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Parents, gouernors, or compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or, were not inſtantly pluckt out of ſome delightfull ſinnes, ere they were rooted in their wickedneſſe, by long cuſtome, &amp;c. And then, what wonder if they liue many yeares without apparent conuerſion and actuall regeneration. Notwithſtanding, if you aske ſome of theſe, after they be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether in the time of their rebellion, they had not ſometimes ſtrong conflicts in themſelues to breake off their wickedneſſe, and to come in; and whether they did not ſometimes finde inward riſings of heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſecret ſinnes, euen for the very filthineſſe of them, as well as for the danger;
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:7446:149"/> and they will, for the moſt part, anſwere, <hi>yea, if they had had the grace to accept and follow thoſe good motions within them: but they found the contrary, that after ſuch inward ſtirrings vnto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, their luſts haue preſently raged and burſt out more ſtrongly, than at other times.</hi> This is the confeſſion, in ſubſtance of diuerſe of them; which ſhewes them not to be wholy deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the ſpirit, euen when the fleſh was moſt violent and inſolent in them, before actuall conuerſion. And this obſeruation (ſeconded by others of farre greater experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) is mentioned here meerely to ſtill their cry which tell vs that, <q>many are vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted thirty, forty, fifty yeares; and is it likely ſay they, the ſpirit ſhould be all that while in them, and neuer actually convert them vnto God.</q> Although he can worke without meanes; yet that he might grace thoſe of his owne inſtitution, hee doth not, vſually worke without them, when hee vouchſafeth them. And when he vſeth them he doth not alwaies performe the worke at the firſt, or ſecond, or many aſſaies of his Miniſters; becauſe hee would haue vs to

               </p>
               <p>By all that haue beene ſpoken, wee now ſee that it is not <hi>vniuerſally</hi> true; which the <hi>Maior Propoſition</hi> ſuppoſeth: <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit must either worke actuall faith and regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or elſe be confeſſed to be idle:</hi> and that it is of no validity which the <hi>Minor</hi> aſſumeth and affirmeth: viz, <hi>that in infants ordinarily no ſuch worke appeareth, but rather the contrary for many yeares after baptiſme:</hi> For, it is poſſible for the ſpirit to worke, although hee doe not worke actuall grace: nor is it materiall, that ſuch grace doth not <hi>appeare</hi> becauſe there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that any particular habit of grace ſhould <hi>bee</hi> at that time in them at all. And therefore I conclude that this <hi>Obiection</hi> is of no ſtrength, foraſmuch as it concludes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the point in Queſtion, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes being thus examined and ſearched to the bottome.</p>

               <p n="2">2 I anſwere that I cannot ſee what ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity would follow by granting that <hi>initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all regeneration</hi> may ſtand with actually reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinne: becauſe howeuer a man hath by the firſt principle of Regeneration a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:7446:151"/> of making oppoſition againſt ſinne when that poſſibility comes into Act: yet he is not by that poſſibility alone enabled, for the preſent, actually to reſiſt ſinne, (which reſiſtance is a fruit of actuall conuerſion) no more than a man is enabled actually to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and diſcourſe ſo ſoone as the reaſonable ſoule is infuſed, before his ſenſes doe actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exerciſe themſelues vpon their proper obiects, and thereby giue occaſion to the rationall faculty to exerciſe it ſelfe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as in an infant which may afterwards proue a very wiſe man, the principle of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may and doth conſiſt with actuall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till that child haue his ſenſes excerciſed to diſcerne betweene good and euill, ſo, in the ſame infant, the firſt principle of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which wee terme <hi>initiall</hi> or<note n="*" place="margin">I call initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>potentiall,</hi> in reſpect of the habits &amp; acts of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular graces.</note>

For, who is he that <hi>giues not himſelfe to ſinne,</hi> but <hi>he that is borne of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 I adde further, that if this obiection were of force againſt <hi>infants,</hi> it would bee much more ſuch, againſt <hi>perſons of yeares</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conuerted.

For, they often ſinne without any apparent reluctati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all. What appearance of the ſpirit in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> when through the ſtrength of feare, and weakneſſe of faith, hee not only denyed his Maſter and Sauiour againe and againe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his conſcience; but (thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the better to ſaue himſelfe, tooke liberty to ſhew himſelfe in that exigent a man of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7446:152"/> ſtampe and diſpoſition, than Chriſt and his Diſciples were of, and fell to rageing, to ſwareing and curſing; when as no man, or thing (vnleſſe his owne feare and cowardiſe) vrged him to it? You will ſay, that was a ſudden vnexpected ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizall, and ſo could not bee a premeditated ſinne; and, he was no ſooner downe, but he got vp againe. True: but this ſatisfieth not. For, in the carriage of that buſineſſe, as ſhort as that time was, what grace appeared? What degree of evill was wanting to make that, in all outward appearance, a <hi>Reigning ſinne?</hi> You will ſay (which indeed is the truth, if S. <hi>Auſtine, Chryſoſtome,</hi> and <hi>Theophilact,</hi> (as<note n="*" place="margin">De Pontif.

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe ſhall witneſſe, bee not deceaued) the ſpirit at that time ſuſpended the act of grace, and lay as it were eclypſed in him, to make him (who before hand boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſo much of his valour,) the better to knowe himſelfe. This I acknowledge to bee true: but this will not ſerue their turnes, who muſt ever ſee the fruits of the ſpirit, or deny him to be there.</p>
               <p>If this of <hi>Peter,</hi> will not ſerue for inſtance
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:7446:152"/> ſufficient to ſhew that ſinne may (as farre as men can iudge by looking on) ſo farre prevaile, as that it may ſeeme to the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to reigne in ſome that are (queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) actually regenerated and renewed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that was but a ſudden aſſault, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted but for a ſmall ſpace: Then what ſay you to <hi>David?</hi> For, howeuer his adultery grew from a ſudden temptation occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obiected, yet his ſending for <hi>Vriah,</hi> the making of him drunke, the murthering of him in the battaile, and the drawing of <hi>Ioab</hi> into the conſpiracy, were deepe premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted plots: and he wallowed in all this mire and blood (as moſt Divines thinke) for the ſpace of almoſt a yeare before he recouered himſelfe, and ere the ſpirit ſtirred in him, ſenſibly, to any purpoſe againe. What ſhew of the ſpirit heere? What oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What was here wanting of <hi>reigning</hi> ſinne? You will ſay, <hi>there might be inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates?</hi> I deny not what <hi>might</hi> bee: but yet ſhew me what appeared. If no worke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in all that time, it is then poſſible that the ſpirit may lye hid, and that for a
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7446:153"/> long time together, in ſome perſons actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuerted, and not be diſcerned. I know Dauid had the ſpirit all that while, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by that prayer of his; <hi>take not thy holy ſpirit from me. Pſal.</hi> 51.11. But I deny any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible working of it that was able to differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <hi>David,</hi> by any outward carrage, in any mans apprehenſion (I except not his owne) from a meere carnall man that euer made any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall ſhew of religion, in the interim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his fall and recouery.</p>
               <p>If any man reply; <hi>Jt is perhaps true that Dauid lay in that miſerable estate, for ſo long a time as you mention: but what is that to ſo many yeares as euen the elect lye in ſinne, before their actuall conuerſion?</hi> To this I muſt anſwere, 1 That if the ſpirit lie hid a yeare, a weeke, or but an houre, hee may (poſſibly) ly hid twenty yeares. That which the obiection driues at is, to proue that, ſuch a thing is <hi>not poſſible to be done at all:</hi> for, that which is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be, for a ſhort time, is not impoſſible, for a longer ſpace. 2. It is more for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to lye hid in a perſon actually converted, for the ſpace of a yeare together, than for
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:7446:153"/> him to lye hid in any other, forty yeares: as it is more for a wiſe man to play the foole once; then for a child, or a foole, to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. 3. If you thinke the inſtance of David not to come home enough, then (for a cloſe) take alſo that of Solomon, his ſonne. He lay yeares enow, ere he repented. He fell from God to flat Idolatry, and that not on the ſudden, but by ſlow degrees: when hee was in it, he lay ſtill for long continuance, in ſo much that ſome make a doubt whether euer he recouered. Yet thoſe men that doe oppoſe this poſition, will not, I thinke, deny Solomon to be regenerated by the ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that fall, or to haue the ſpirit ſtill abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in him in all that time of his fall, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him againe. Therefore it cannot reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably be denied that, foraſmuch as the ſpirit may and ſometimes doth lye hid in perſons actually regenerate, for a long time together not ſhewing it ſelfe apparently in oppoſition againſt great and ſcandalous ſinnes; it is not impoſſible for the ſpirit to be in an infant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the time of his Baptiſme vntill his actuall converſion without any ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7446:154"/> oppoſition againſt ſinne, as may giue the perſon in whom he is, any ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that the dominion of ſinne is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from out of his ſoule. So much, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the <hi>Major.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 To the <hi>Minor Propoſition</hi> (that, <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ſinne raigneth, till they bee actually regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>) I anſwere that there is a <hi>Dominion</hi> in the full ſtrength, and a Dominion that is in the wane, like that of a Prince who yet is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of his kingdome which daily waxeth (like the houſe of Saul) weaker and weaker. There is a Dominion which is more <hi>intenſe</hi> and in the higheſt degree: and there is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion which is more <hi>remiſſe,</hi> and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called. This diſtinction hath foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the ſcripture, which ſaith of ſome that <hi>ſinne ſhall not haue dominion ouer them:</hi> and the reaſon is added, becauſe they <hi>are vnder grace,</hi> Rom. 6.14. this is a Dominion in the <hi>higheſt</hi> degree. It ſaith vnto others, <hi>let not ſigne reigne in your mortall bodies,</hi> Rom. 6.12. This is a Dominion in a more <hi>remiſſe</hi> degree, as ſinne is taken for a maſterly tyrant that hath, by want of vigilancy in a Chriſtian, gotten the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7446:154"/> vpper hand in ſome particular. Vnto this they to whom he wrote were ſubiect, if they looked not the better about them. For the Apoſtle himſelfe, euen after his actuall rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, complaines that ſinne was yet a <hi>Law in his members warring againſt the law of his minde, and bringing him into captiuitie to the law of ſinne.</hi> Rom. 7.23. Now, in that hee calls the power of ſinne by the name of a <hi>Law,</hi> that did captivate him, hee plainely intendeth to giue vs notice of ſome kinde of ſoueraignty which ſinne, at ſome times, exerciſed ouer him, after his conuerſion. This will appeare by comparing this phraſe with the very ſame in <hi>ver.</hi> 1.2. <hi>The Law hath dominion ouer a man as long as he liueth. For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband ſo long as he liueth: but if her husband be dead, ſhee is looſed from the law of her husband:</hi> that is, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the power and ſoueraigne authority, which in the family her husband did exerciſe ouer her. So that where there is a law in force, &amp; exerciſing it ſelfe, there is a kinde of domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for none can ſet vp a law, and giue ſuch life vnto it, but ſuch as haue ſoueraigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7446:155"/> And if it might be thus in <hi>Paul;</hi> then much more, in the Romanes to whom hee wrote Therefore he bids them to take heed and not to let <hi>it raigne that they ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof.</hi> And yet they were regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; for hee ſaith, <hi>they were vnder grace (ver.</hi> 14.) and ſo vnder grace, that hee aſſureth them, <hi>ſinne ſhould not haue dominion ouer them;</hi> as there he ſpeaketh: that is, not an <hi>abſolute</hi> &amp; <hi>compleat dominion,</hi> which cannot ſtand with ſauing grace; although they were in danger to be vnder <hi>ſome kinde of Dominion</hi> of it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Grace. So then, there is an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute dominion</hi> which cannot conſiſt with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace: and there is an <hi>improper</hi> &amp; more <hi>remiſſe dominion,</hi> which may bee for a while, in the ſame ſubiect, with ſauing grace. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man aske me, what that <hi>abſolute dominion</hi> is; in a word I conceiue it be this; viz: <hi>Such a compleat ſoueraignty over the whole man as makes him to be</hi> totus, totum, in toto peccato, <hi>whole, wholy, in the whole ſinne he giues himſelfe vp vnto, wittingly, willingly, wilfully; deſiring he may euer liue in that ſinne and enioy his fill of it, that there were no law forbidding it, nor God to puniſh it;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7446:155"/> and, although there be both, yet hee will follow it ſtill, and cannot for his heart ſo much as get free of the loue of it &amp; deſire after it, but will part with any thing rather then with his ſinne.</hi> This, in ſcripture, is called, <hi>preſumptuous ſinne. Pſalme</hi> 19. But this no man can warrantably affirme to be in <hi>Elect</hi> perſons after their baptiſme, euen before their actuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. And I thinke if I ſhould deny the propoſition, they that frame it had neede to take day enough to proue it. For to tell me that, they commit many groſſe and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſinnes; that, they be ſome of them (as <hi>Paul</hi> was) <hi>perſecutors and blaſphemers,</hi> doth not ſufficiently proue that ſinne hath any <hi>abſolute</hi> Dominion ouer them, <hi>ordinarily,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, in reſpect of their outward carriage, no man can diſcerne their ſinnes to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>reigning ſinnes:</hi> for ſo, you know, doe many ſinnes committed by ſuch as are actually renewed. Therefore their outward carriage alone is not enough to warrant ſuch a cenſure of them. That ſinne reigneth and domineereth as a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ouer them, in a more remiſſe degree
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7446:156"/> than he doth in reprobates, is too too euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by daily leading them into captiuity to the law of ſinne. This is not denied But for any man to ſay that the elect, after their baptiſme till their actuall conuerſion and regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are vnder that abſolute and compleat do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſinne, that the diuells and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates are, is a thing which may be ſaid, but will neuer be proued. For, ſuppoſe the ſpirit did not worke any generall diſpoſitions and inclinations vnto grace in infants (which yet the ſoundeſt diuines affirme) yet it is ſomething that there is that in them which will ſo farre abate the edge of the malice of ſinne that they cannot ſinne that great ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt No elect perſon can (according to the principles which the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to this point and I agree in,) ſinne that ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt; as the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites will freely confeſſe: for, if he could, how were it poſſible for him to be at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and ſaued? And if, notwithſtanding his want of <hi>actuall</hi> regeneration, he cannot ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, I demand then, what is it that keepes him from that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7446:156"/> ſinne? Is it not the ſpirit that reſtraines and curbes the malice of his corruption againſt God and his grace? But you will ſay this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint is common to reprobates as well as to the elect, for the moſt part; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may (ſay you) as well proue the ſpirit to be in the one, as in the other; if this be all the ground I haue for it. To which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne that there is a maine difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the elect and reprobate: <hi>viz.</hi> that the Elect not only <hi>doth</hi> not, but <hi>cannot</hi> commit that ſinne: for, the ſpirit keepes him that hee may be a veſſell of grace and honour: but the reprobates are reſtrained, not by the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt;</hi> but rather by the <hi>powerfull proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God</hi> meerely that they might not hurt the Elect, as otherwaies they would doe. And yet notwithſtanding that reſtraint, they are neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted nor ſaued; which ſhewes that they neuer had the ſpirit of Chriſt. Nor is there in the elect ſo neere approaches to that ſinne, as there is in reprobates. But of this I ſhall haue ſome occaſion to ſpeake more afterwards; therefore I ſpare to adde more thereof in this place; praying the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7446:157"/> to remember that, I haue ſundry other grounds beſide this; ſo as, what euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of this, the point it ſelfe cannot ſuffer by it, ſo long as the other ſtand vnbattered. And thus much of this <hi>ſixth Obiection.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 To the <hi>maior;</hi> that it may be vnderſtood three waies, &amp; it holds true but only in one of the three.

               <p n="1">1 It is no good arguing; Paul had not the ſpirit, in circumciſion; therefore none of the Elect did ordinarily then receiue it.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:7446:160"/> ouer them, at ſome times, in ſom particulars, ſinne may be ſaid to reigne; becauſe it hath ſo gotten the vpper hand, that it <hi>leads them captiue:</hi> yet it doth not <hi>abſolutely reigne,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doe not freely and wholy giue themſelues vp vnto it, without any deſire to change Lords.

In the ſame ſenſe alſo, the ſame Apoſtle calls them <hi>carnall.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 3.3. whom but a little before (<hi>ver:</hi> 1.) hee had pronounced <hi>babes in Chriſt.</hi> This place therefore proues not Paul to bee without the ſpirit, in his circumciſion: no more then it proues him to bee deſtitute thereof euen after his actuall Regeneration. Wherefore, now I turne this weapon backe vpon the Obiectors themſelues, and vrge it thus againſt them: If the ſpirit may be in ſuch as are <hi>carnall and ſold vnder ſinne,</hi> then hee may be in elect infants, although carnall and ſold vnder ſinne. For if he may be yet in part, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, whom no man will deny to haue the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:7446:160"/> ſpirit: the ſpirit may bee in elect infants that are not, after Baptiſme, vnder an <hi>abſolute</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſinne, as hath beene before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. So farre as there is any fleſh not totally ſubdued, ſo farre there is a want of the ſpirit even in a perſon regenerated: therefore ſo farre as there is the leaſt abatement of the <hi>abſolute</hi> Dominion of ſinne, there is the ſpirit notwithſtanding that the party be yet ſo far <hi>carnall,</hi> as that he is <hi>ſold vnder ſinne,</hi> and <hi>led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to the law of ſinne</hi> in the generall courſe of his converſation, till actuall regeneration be wrought within him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That place in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. (where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>J was a blaſphemer, a perſecutor, &amp; iniurious,</hi>) proues not <hi>Paul</hi> to be vtterly void of the ſpirit, till his actuall Regeneration: for if it doth, it muſt bee, either becauſe the <hi>facts</hi> were ſo haynous as cannot agree to a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man; or, becauſe he committed them with ſuch a <hi>witting malice,</hi> as cannot ſubſiſt with the ſpirit of God, in the ſame ſubiect.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That Paul did not commit thoſe ſinnes out of malice to Chriſt &amp; goodneſſe, nor ſo much as out of knowledge: but onely out of ignorance that, the <hi>way</hi> which hee <hi>blaſphemed</hi> and <hi>perſecuted,</hi> was the <hi>truth.</hi>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:7446:161"/> He made conſcience of the Law of God, ſo farre forth as hee knewe it to bee the Law, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. and was <hi>zealous towards God, Act.</hi> 22.3. even before his conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

So it followes in that very Text now vrged againſt me: <hi>but I obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, becauſe I did it ignorantly.</hi> Yea further he profeſſeth that, he did no more then what he thought himſelfe bound in conſcience to doe, meerly in obedience vnto God. For, ſaith he, <hi>J verily thought with my ſelfe that I ought to doe many things contrary to the name of Ieſus of Nazareth, Act.</hi> 26.9. And vpon this ground, he did all thoſe things, wherewith hee ſo deeply chargeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: Now, if Dauid that committed as great ſinnes for kinde, and greater, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of circumſtances, (for hee did it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, willingly, with premeditation, knowing very well that hee ought not to haue done any thing of that he did) ſhall be allowed to haue the ſpirit, euen at that
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:7446:162"/> very time; with what reaſon can wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the ſpirit to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul when he did thoſe things, which in that text of 1. Tim. 1.13. he ſo much bewaileth and condemneth in himſelfe; for as much as hee proteſteth that all this was but through ignorance of the truth, &amp; blind zeale towards God and the truth, doing nothing wittingly either againſt God or his conſcience, but only that which he erroniouſly ſuppoſed would be acceptable vnto God. All this therefore, makes for mee, and no way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me.</p>
               <p n="3">3 As for that place in <hi>Tit</hi> 3.3. which is thought to make ſtrongeſt againſt me, it is as weake as thoſe other two already exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Wee were ſometimes fooliſh, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle.

Nor is there one ſyllable of his own Circumciſion, nor any circumſtance of the Text that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires vs ſo to vnderſtand it. But, he himſelf was circumciſed? True: yet there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:7446:162"/> in that place, that he was ſuch after cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, as that he could not haue the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit at all in him. He only ſhewes what he, &amp; they, and all men are by nature, before their effectuall calling, or rather before their firſt initiation into Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It will bee replied, that this place ſhewes what he was euen after Circumciſion: for it containes a confeſſion of ſundry <hi>actual ſinnes</hi> which muſt needs bee committed after his circumciſion, becauſe hee was circumciſed the eight day after his birth, at which age he could not commit thoſe actuall ſinnes?

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:7446:163"/> drawne from this Text would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) that the ſpirit is ſo giuen either in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, or in Baptiſme, as to keepe the elect from actuall ſinnes; it is enough that the ſpirit takes off that extremity of malice which is to be found in the ſinnes of ſuch as are not elected.</p>
               <p>But haply, there may bee more pregnant evidence in the words following: viz: in <hi>ver.</hi> 4.5.6.7. I am content to ioine iſſue here alſo. The words are theſe. <hi>But after that the loue and kindneſſe of God our Saviour toward man appeared; not by workes of righteouſneſſe which we haue done, but according to his mercy he ſaued vs.</hi> By what? <hi>By the lauer of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on vs abundantly through Ieſus Chriſt our Saviour, that being justified freely by his grace, wee ſhould bee made heyres according to the hope of eternall life.</hi> And what of all this? Doth any of this proue that Paul had not the ſpirit in his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion? Yes, you will ſay, it doth. For Paul herein declares <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>when,</hi> hee and the reſt of whom he there ſpeakes, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated: <hi>viz:</hi> in their Baptiſme, of which
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:7446:163"/> they were partakers, not till they were of ripe age, ſo as by faith they apprehended the inward grace, and ſo came to be partakers of the ſpirit. But doth this place proue that Paul had not the ſpirit before his baptiſme? I trow not; for then who wrought in him that faith to apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the grace of his baptiſme? Rather therfore it proues the contrary, that he receiued it in his circumciſion: for it is plaine, he had it before. And if he had it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, why not in his Circumciſion? <q>No, may ſome man ſay; not ſo for in <hi>Acts</hi> 9.17. <hi>Ananias</hi> deales with him as with a meere carnall man wholy deſtitute of grace, and tells him that God had ſent him to him that, <hi>he might be filled with the holy Ghoſt:</hi> and, it followes in the next place, that, <hi>he was baptized,</hi> which ſhewes that hee had not the Holy Ghoſt before that time.</q> But to this I anſwere breefly that, this proues not that he had not the ſpirit, in any meaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time: for, it is not ſaid, that God had ſent <hi>Ananias</hi> vnto him that he might <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue</hi> the Holy Ghoſt; but <hi>that</hi> he might bee <hi>filled</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt: and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7446:164"/> vnto ſanctification but to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of an Apoſtolicall function: for it is afterward added, <hi>that straight way he preached Chriſt in the Synagogue. ver.</hi> 20. Now although he receiued the ſpirit in his circumciſion, yet he was not <hi>filled</hi> with the ſpirit, nor was he filled with the ſpirit in the firſt inſtant of his reception of it, at what time ſoeuer hee firſt receiued it, for the ſpirit doth not worke all his graces at once but by degrees. It may here bee remembred what haue beene formerly ſpoken vpon that place in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> bids thoſe that <hi>were pricked at their hearts, to repent and be baptized;</hi> telling them that, ſo they <hi>ſhould receiue the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now if they muſt <hi>repent;</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they muſt haue the Holy Ghoſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them herevnto, elſe they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Therefore it muſt be confeſſed that their receiuing of the ſpirit in baptiſme was no ſufficient proofe that they were not at all partakers of him before they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. Before they receiued him; but more ſecretly, and ſparingly: now, they receiued him againe; but more ſolemnely, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully.
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7446:164"/> And thus wee ſee that none of theſe places apart or together, no not when they be wyre drawne to the vtmoſt, haue in them any ſolid proofe to make good the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> propoſition, that <hi>the spirit was not giuen in circumciſion:</hi> and ſo wee haue ouerthrowne this argument alſo; without the leaſt preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to our poſition.</p>

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7446:165"/> ſpirit before baptiſme. Howbeit that place in the 10. of the <hi>Acts</hi> is improperly alleaged for it; becauſe it ſpeakes of an extraordinary beſtowing of the ſpirit vpon ſuch as <hi>Peter</hi> preached vnto, in reſpect of the gift of <hi>tongues,</hi> as appeares in <hi>verſ.</hi> 45.46. where it is ſaid that, <hi>they of the circumciſion which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, were aſtoniſhed, as many as came with Peter, becauſe that on the gentiles alſo was powred out the gift of the Holy ghoſt: for they heard them ſpeake with tongues, and magnified God.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, I ſay, It is manifeſt that faith and repentance were to precede the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of ſuch as were of yeares, at leaſt the publique and ſolemne profeſſion of thoſe graces was to be made by them, before they were baptized.

               <p n="2">2 I ſay that howeuer ſome places doe ſuppoſe the ſpirit to be giuen before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, yet that proues not that therefore thoſe places of ſcripture which I haue alleadged, doe proue no ſuch thing as I would inferre thence; becauſe I haue not brought one of thoſe places for a proofe, which mention <hi>actuall</hi> faith and repentance, foraſmuch as they concerne perſons of yeares only. Now this obiection would haue the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that I haue taken vp ſome of thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for my vſe, which ſpeake clearly of faith and repentance going before baptiſme: which is not ſo. And ſo it doth caſt an vniuſt aſpertion vpon me, and not giue any blow to the point it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 I neuer affirmed that infants doe not at all receiue the ſpirit before their baptiſme; but only that, Baptiſme is the firſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or meanes applied for their firſt <hi>ſolemne</hi>

Admit that they had the ſpirit before, yet it followes not that they receiue him not alſo in baptiſme, in reſpect of confirmation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if not in reſpect of a further degree and meaſure of his grace. The Holy Ghoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended vpon Chriſt in his baptiſme: yet no man will ſay Chriſt had not the ſpirit before he was baptized. They in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. before mentioned were bid to <hi>repent</hi> before they were baptized, and no doubt they did ſo, which yet could not be without the ſpirit, as I haue often ſaid: And yet for all that, The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle aſſured them that in Baptiſme they ſhould <hi>receiue the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> What letteth then, why elect infants ſhould not doe ſo too? I conclude therefore that, in perſons of yeares the ſpirit muſt goe before, to qualify them with actuall grace thereby to make them capable of the inward grace of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: and to elect infants alſo, the ſpirit may be giuen before baptiſme: but yet both vnto the one and vnto the other he is giuen againe

The Apoſtle intends not there, to ſhew the difference betweene the elect and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, in their infancy; nor to declare that, then they differ when they come to age, by the actuall converſion of the one, and the finall impenitency of the other: but, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Perkins</hi> vpon the place well ſaith; <hi>The Apoſtle vſeth a ſimilitude borrowed from the Ciuill Law, and it may be framed thus. Heyres in their minority liue in ſubiection to Tutors and Gouernors; but when they are of riper yeares, at the appointment of their parents, they are at liberty. Euen ſo the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, before Chriſt, were in their infancy, vnder the law, as vnder a Tutor: but when the fulneſſe of time was come, which God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they entred into the fruition of their liberty.</hi> Thus hee.

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:7446:167"/> For, let any man view the place well, and he ſhall finde the Apoſtle to haue no other purpoſe at all, then to proue Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty from Moſaicall ceremonies of the Law, by the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh, who was the body and ſubſtance of all thoſe ſhaddowes; and that vntill this time, even the true heires by virtue of Gods election, were as much bound to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of thoſe legall rites; as any others whatſoeuer, but now were freed from them, <hi>in the fulneſſe of time,</hi> by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt.

For howeuer this laſt, in ſome ſenſe, be true too, yet it may well deſerue to be queſtioned, whether it bee the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Text. But admit this alſo: yet I ſay, what formerly I haue ſaid in <hi>chap.</hi> 3. that there is no danger to ſay that God is tied, ſo farre forth as he hath vouchſafed to promiſe to be preſent in his owne Ordinance, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily: nor is it vntrue to ſay ſo, nor vnwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable to expect it, yea and (in an humble manner) to require it of him. Whatſoeuer God hath promiſed, we may ſafely ſay, hee is tied to performe: for he is tied by that which cannot but hold him: viz: his owne <hi>Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Therefore the Pſalmiſt challengeth God as engaged to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.49. <hi>Remember
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:7446:168"/> the promiſe vnto thy ſeruant, wherein thou haſt cauſed me to put my truſt.</hi> And God bids his children doe it; yea, to <hi>command</hi> him: <hi>Iſay</hi> 45.11. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the Holy One of Jſrael and his Maker; Aske of me things to come concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my ſonnes, and concerning the worke of my hands</hi> COMMAND <hi>yee me.</hi> That is, what euer I haue promiſed, require it, ſpare not, ſo they doe it in any humble manner. Now that Poſition which only affirmes God to be preſent ordinarily, where hee by virtue of his promiſe hath engaged himſelfe to bee, doth not lay any vnwarrantable tye vpon God, but rather giues him the honour of his fidelity, &amp; puts comfort into his people, by giving them aſſurance of it.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing diſtinguiſhed of the <hi>Major</hi> and made it appeare that there may bee an affirmation ſafe and true, which ſaith, <hi>God is tyed or engaged vnto ſome things,</hi> ſo long as any promiſe going before can bee found to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him: I come now to deny the <hi>Minor,</hi> becauſe how euer that Poſition which ties God where he hath not tied himſelfe muſt needs be not only falſe, but full of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:7446:169"/> alſo; yet this poſition is no way guilty of any ſuch thing. For God hath made a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> to ſhew himſelfe thus gratious in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of baptiſme, ordinarily, when it is adminiſtred to elect infants, as the learned Author of the Commentary vpon the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> expreſly avoucheth, ſaying; <hi>here by virtue of his</hi> PROMISE <hi>we may expect it, here we may and ought ſend out the prayer of faith for it.</hi> If any man ſhall doubt hereof, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand where any ſuch promiſe is to bee found; I would referre him to <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1. to <hi>Math.</hi> 3 as alſo to the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Baptiſme, wherein a promiſe is involued: to <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. wherein a promiſe is ſuppoſed; &amp;, to ſundry places moe.

Therefore I leaue this worke to him, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to another obiection, after I haue added
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:7446:169"/> one ſhort Advertiſement to ſuch as will not be ſatisfied either by me, or by him, or by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man elſe, with any reaſon. Some there are, who complaine that, howeuer many Scriptures haue beene alleaged by mee and others, to proue that the ſpirit is giuen in baptiſme: yet they cannot ſee any one place of Scripture that ſaith directly &amp; in expreſſe termes, that, <hi>The spirit is giuen to elect infants, in Baptiſme.</hi> Shew them but that they ſay, and they haue done. But if they bee ſuch as allow of the baptiſme of infants, let them ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie me in another thing, and I will ſoone giue content to them in their demand. Let them ſhew me where the Scripture ſpeaks, in expreſſe termes, of <hi>the Baptiſme of infants</hi> by name, and I will ſhew them an expreſſe text for the communication of the ſpirit vnto <hi>elect Jnfants</hi> by name, in their baptiſme. Here I knowe they will ſay that, it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to bring expreſſe words of Scripture that ſaith the ſame thing in ſo many ſyllables, but it is enough if it bee concluded thence by ſound conſequence: and herein they ſay the truth.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:7446:171"/> fault in him that ſhould ſo neere trench vpon Popery, as to vſe thoſe actions in ſuch a manner: becauſe the Apoſtle giues charge <hi>abſtaine from all appearance of euill:</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.22. And the ſame Apoſtle profeſſeth in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of meats offered vnto Idols, that <hi>he would eate no fleſh while the world ſtandeth, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might make his brother to offend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>But as for <hi>Poſitions,</hi> wherein the truth is explained, and the contrary diſclaimed, I muſt craue leaue to be of another opinion. For I cannot be of their minde who hold that nothing muſt be deliuered which may ſeeme to ſome hearers or Readers to trench too neere vpon Popiſh abſurdity, ſo long as it be not indeed a popiſh abſurdity, but the truth; and that the difference betweene that truth, and the popiſh abſurdity, to which it is ſuppoſed to leane, be ſo fully manifeſted and cleared, as all that are capable of truth and willing to receiue the ſame, may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne it, if they pleaſe. I like not that vaine conceit (which hath drawne after it many abſurdities indeed; and thoſe, of dangerous conſequence) that wee ſhould, in all points,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:7446:172"/> goe as farre from Papiſts and other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as poſſibly wee can This is that which neuer did good; ever did, and will doe hurt, when men will take that to be the truth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which ſtandeth in moſt direct oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that which is knowne and confeſſed to be a groſſe error, for, as in ſome perſons, it is only a <hi>degree</hi> of heat or cold ouer and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the iuſt temper, that makes them of ſuch a poiſonous quality, ſo as if they be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by ſome other ingredient) they may not only proue ſafe, but very vſefull to the party to whom they are adminiſtred; ſo it is in many Propoſitions, which, as they are propounded, may containe ſome falſhood in them; yet may be ſo qualified and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as that a ſmall addition, or ſubſtraction might make them paſſe current, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out all that venome of falſhood contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them when they ſtand without thoſe qualifications added to them.</p>
               <p>If wee goe any one ſtep, in any one point, from the groſſeſt Hereticks in the world fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than meere neceſſity of truth compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, they will ſoone (and that iuſtly) open
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:7446:172"/> their mouthes againſt vs, and complaine that, wee ſtudy, not ſo much to maintaine the truth as to croſſe them; and, that it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for vs to diſclaime any truth, becauſe they hold it. What can follow hence but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme obſtinacy in ſuch as are out of the way, (and vnder obloquy for it) when they ſhall diſcerne and be able to plead that, wee doe hold that, a direct oppoſition to them in all things, is the beſt and ſafeſt rule to walk by; whereas they, in the meane time, can make it appeare that, howeuer they may be wide in ſome degrees from the truth, yet not ſo many degrees as we would make the world beleeue: for, in ſuch and ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars they can proue it to all men capable of vnderſtanding, that they erre not; and yet we will not conſent vnto them ſo farre, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ingenious man will confeſſe them to haue truth on their ſide? For my part, I will not giue ſuch an advantage vnto any aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, but rather hold my ſelfe bound to aſſent vnto him, be he Papiſt, Familiſt, Turk, or Iew, in any truth whatſoeuer: ſo that I may haue liberty to expreſſe my ſelfe clearly,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:7446:173"/> how and to what end I hold that truth with him, and that I diſclaime all ſuch vſes as he puts that truth abuſiuely vnto.</p>
               <p>Nor doe I take vp this reſolution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant, but haue vnquarrellable preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for it For marke. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that, in matter of <hi>practiſe,</hi> hee would be carefull not to offend a weake brother, euen in thoſe things which are not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſimply vnlawfull; yet hee would not; for any mans ſake, refuſe to declare his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning the lawfulneſſe of the things that cannot be ſimply and abſolutly condemned, how much ſoeuer they haue beene, and perhaps ſtill are vnlawfully abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their vſe. Hee giues inſtance in the matter of meats offered vnto Idols, in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. before mentioned. Some were of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that they might be lawfully eaten, being receiued with thankſgiuing and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and without reference to the Idoll, or doubting about it. Others held the contrary, and were ſo ſtiffe in their opinion that they not only refuſed to eat thereof themſelues, but tooke great offence at others, that vpon
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:7446:173"/> any reaſon whatſoeuer tooke more liberty therein, than they did. The Apoſtle comes in as an Vmpire betweene them. He conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that for matter of practiſe he would ſo farre gratify the weake that he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to eate of ſuch meats: yet firſt proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that very place, that he could not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his iudgment to be ſo farre captivated: nor the truth to be ſo much wronged, as not to hold the thing lawfull in it ſelfe. Therfore in point of iudgment he concurred with thoſe that held the truth, but in matter of practiſe he profeſſeth his diſſent from them becauſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

By which wee ſee that the abuſe of any truth muſt not make any man vnwilling to hold it euen with thoſe that doe abuſe it, ſo long as he abſtaine from the abuſe wherof they are guilty. Therefore my diſcretion will not be much wounded by this obiection; vnleſſe it can appeare that this doth <hi>indeed,</hi> as well as in <hi>ſhew,</hi> trench too neere vpon <hi>Popiſh abſurdities,</hi> as the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> affirmeth; which now I come vnto.</p>

If this aſſertion be any way guilty of what it is charged withall, it muſt be either becauſe it aſcribes ſuch a Phyſicall efficacy (as they terme it) to the outward element of water, after conſecration, that the very wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould haue force in it, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the inward grace to euery perſon bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; at leaſt, to the <hi>elect,</hi> ſo ſoone as they are ſprinkled or waſhed with it in the name of the Father, and of the ſonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt, by vertue of that externall worke done and performed outwardly by the Miniſter: or elſe becauſe it iumps with, or at leaſt drawes too neere to that other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of theirs, touching the impreſſion of an <hi>indelible character</hi> vpon the ſoule of euery one that is outwardly baptized, whether he be elected, or not.</p>

But I ſay expreſly that the ſpirit is giuen immediatly by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at the ſame inſtant wherein the Miniſter performeth the outward act of baptiſme. Now the Popiſh tenent is directly contrary to all this, as they well know that vnderſtand what the Papiſts hold in this particular. And it were but an vnthrifty waſt of time &amp; paper, to ſet downe the ſame more at large.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is no leſſe free from the other abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:7446:175"/> of the <hi>Indeleble character.</hi> This may bee ſufficiently euident, by ſhewing their doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine herein, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring it with the point in hand. It is very true that the popiſh ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpeake much and often of this ſuppoſed <hi>character,</hi> which euery one that is baptized, according to their fancy, receiueth in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; and this Character, they ſay, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be blotted out againe, in any of thoſe that haue once receiued it. Howbeit, (as <hi>Soto,</hi> out of <hi>Scotus</hi> affirmeth and confeſſeth) this doctrine was neuer knowne to the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> becauſe neither <hi>Lombard</hi> nor <hi>Gratian,</hi> who tooke vpon them to collect all that the Fathers had written touching baptiſme, doe make any mention of it. Therefore it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to be a new device of the latter ſchoolemen, hatched after <hi>Lombard</hi> was dead and rotten. But that Poſition which is here defended is of more antiquity in the Church of Chriſt, as appeares by thoſe teſtimonies of the Fathers before alleadged, to which it were eaſy to adde many more, if neede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>After that toy was ſet abroach in the

This is manifeſt to all that are conuerſant in their writings, of which the learned<note n="f" place="margin">De Sacram. l. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>12.</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Chameir</hi> among many others, haue drawne a ſhort ſurvey. And as men differed about it when they were apart; ſo they were not able to compoſe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, when they met together in their Grand Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelfe, where there was no ſmall ſtirre about it, as we are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Author of the<note n="g" place="margin">

                  <hi>History of that Councell.</hi> 
                  <q>It was worth the knowing, ſaith he, what thing they meant by it, &amp; where ſituated, in ſuch multiplicity of Schoole opinions. Some made it a quality: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe were fowre opinions, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fowre kinds of qualities: ſome, a ſpirituall power: ſome, an habit or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: others, a ſpirituall figure: and the opinion that it was a ſenſible metaphorical quality, wanted not abettors. Some would haue it a reall relation: ſome, a fabricke of the minde, who had ſomewhat to doe to declare how farre it differed from nothing.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:7446:176"/>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſame variety of opinions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>ſubiect,</hi> was troubleſome. Some placed it in the eſſence of the ſoule: ſome, in the vnderſtanding: ſome, in the Will. And there wanted not, who gaue it place in the hands and tongue. <hi>Hierome</hi> of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, a Dominican Frier, thought that the Sacrament did imprint a ſpirituall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity before the comming of grace; &amp; that it was of two ſorts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One, which can neuer be aboliſhed; the other, which may bee loſt, and regained. The former was called a Character; the latter, a certaine orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Sacraments which giue the firſt, cannot be reiterated, becauſe their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect euer remaineth: the other, may, when their effect is loſt. This carried a faire ſhew, but was not approued of by many, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no other Author of that ornament, but their <hi>S. Thomas of Aquine;</hi> who alſo, though he begat it, yet did not thinke it worthy of education.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In ſo much perplexed contrariety of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions they durſt not conclude expreſly, what that <hi>Jndeleble Character</hi> was. Yet in
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7446:176"/> their ſeauenth <hi>Seſſion Can.</hi> 9. they boldly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathematized all, <hi>that, in Baptiſme, Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; Orders, ſhall ſay, no indeleble Character is imprinted vpon the ſoule.</hi> Nor haue their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Champions, <hi>Vaſquez, Suarez, Bellarmine, Valentian,</hi> and others, who haue ſtood vp in the defence of that Councell, beene able to bring the point to any head: no, nor yet his Holineſſe himſelfe, with all his infallible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, hath vouchſafed to explaine his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, or to helpe out his Vaſſalls in defining preciſely what that thing is. Surely, here is need of implicit faith indeed, when euen the very greateſt and moſt admired Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of the Church, cannot yet tel what they hold and beleeue diſtinctly herein. It is not to be denied but that (with much labour) a man might find out thoſe particulars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they doe in ſome ſort agree. But they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree rather in declaring negatiuely what it is not; then in concluding poſitiuely and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiuely what the thing is. This I ſhal be able to make good out of the induſtrious collections of<note n="g" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Chameir,</hi> wherein wee ſhall find that the Papals doe agree in theſe things
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7446:177"/> (if wee may take Bellarmines words for it;) <hi>viz:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 In determining <hi>what it is not: viz:</hi> that it is not any grace, but a thing diſtinct from it, which makes them diſpoſed and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receiue or adminiſter things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Divine Worſhip. They will not haue it to be faith, iuſtification, rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or the gift of the ſpirit himſelfe. All theſe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> diſclaimes.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In determining <hi>to whom it is giuen: viz.</hi> to all that receiue the Sacraments, whether worthily or vnworthily: ſo as it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing peculiar to ſuch as are ſaued, but common alſo to ſuch as are damned, who doe carry this indeleble Character with them to Hell it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In determining <hi>in what Sacraments</hi> the Character is giuen: <hi>viz:</hi> not only in <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> but in <hi>Confirmation,</hi> and in <hi>Orders</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; both of which they put into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Sacraments; as they doe alſo, <hi>Marriage, Pennance,</hi> and <hi>Extreme Vnction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 In determining <hi>in what manner</hi> it is confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: <hi>viz, ex opere operato,</hi> meerely by virtue
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:7446:177"/> of the externall adminiſtration of thoſe their Sacraments; ſo as (if the Papiſts ſay true) no man can miſſe of that ſuppoſed Character, ſo ſoone as he partakes of the outward part (I meane, the outward ſignes) of thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">Although I vſe their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeech, in calling <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>By all this it appeareth that there is a vaſt difference betweene that figment &amp; Popiſh abſurdity of the <hi>indeleble Character,</hi> and this poſition which is here defended. For, 1. they are yet to ſeeke touching the very <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the thing; and howeuer in the generall they hold it to be a <hi>kinde of quality,</hi> yet they will haue it to bee ſuch as differs from all grace, and from the ſpirit of grace. But I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme clearely and roundly that, it is <hi>the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace</hi> that is giuen in baptiſme, which they deny 2. They teach that their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is giuen to <hi>all,</hi> without exception of any of the reprobates themſelues. I affirme that the ſpirit is giuen only vnto the <hi>Elect,;</hi> and, to them, <hi>ordinarily,</hi> not alwaies, but that ſome may and doe receiue the ſpirit, before baptiſme; ſome, after it. 3. They teach that there is a Character giuen in <hi>Confirmation,</hi> &amp;
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:7446:178"/> 
                  <hi>Orders,</hi> as well as in Baptiſme I ſpeake only of what is giuen in Baptiſme. 4. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme their Character to be giuen by <hi>virtue of the outward worke done:</hi> I ſay the ſpirit is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>only by Chriſt himſelfe</hi> immediatly.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I conclude that this poſition doth every way ſo far differ from that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, that it hath no likeneſſe in it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, in any reſpect at all. I neuer taught other thing then that, <hi>the ſpirit is giuen ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, to elect Infants, in their baptiſme, to be the firſt principle of future grace, and, in the meane time, to ſeale them vp for Chriſt.</hi> If any pleaſe to call this an <hi>Indeleble Character,</hi>

               <p>A carnall perſon, ſay you, when he heares it proued and ſo much inculcated that, <hi>the Elect doe, ordinarily, receiue the ſpirit and firſt principle of grace, in their Baptiſme,</hi> will be ouer
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:7446:179"/> apt to conclude thence, as followeth; <hi>Why then, there is no ſuch need of ſo much preaching, hearing, praying, faſting, &amp;c. For if I belong to God, J haue the spirit in me already, how wicked ſoeuer J appeare to others to be; and I haue had the ſpirit, euer ſince I was baptized. And, if the ſpirit, I cannot miſſe of grace and ſaluation, though J ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heare ſermon nor pray, all the daies of my life, but follow my luſts as freely as any man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I ſay, that if a man will be ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he may. But who is in fault but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? May not he conclude as much from both the other? &amp; is it not perpetually baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the <hi>Arminians: viz.</hi> 
                  <q>that the doctrine of Gods abſolute election taught by the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> (as they pleaſe to nickname all maintainers therof) doth make many men exceedingly preſumptuous and ſecure; it occaſioneth in them ſuch deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions as theſe, <hi>If I bee elected I ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſaued, let me liue as J list, and doe what I will; what need I care for prayer, ſermons, holineſſe of life, &amp;c. If I ſhall be ſaued; I ſhall bee ſaued, let mee doe what I will to hinder it.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>But if J be not elected, I ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:7446:180"/> let me doe what I can to preuent it.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, how is the comfortable Doctrine of <hi>finall perſeuerance</hi> daily calumniated; as if it taught no leſſe ſecurity and preſumption, than the former. <q>
                     <hi>will not this, ſaith the Arminian, make men careleſſe and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, when they ſhall be told that,</hi> let them doe what they will, they cannot either final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or totally looſe all grace, if euer they had any at all? <hi>Will not ſuch perſons co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude againſt any man that ſhall exhort them, vpon any falls into ſome groſſe ſinnes, to ſpeedy and ſerious repentance; that,</hi> hee is much mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in them: they are ſure that they had grace once, and they are taught by ſuch and ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, that they can neuer looſe all grace againe, by any ſinnes never ſo groſſe and ſcandalous: therfore, no neceſſity of any ſuch haſt vnto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as he pretendeth. Their ſtate is good and ſure enough. They haue that in them which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be loſt: and that being not lost, they cannot miſcarry.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It may not be diſſembled that ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concluſions may be made from thoſe heauenly Doctrines by helliſh men. But yet
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:7446:180"/> we can finde anſwers to all ſuch obiections, eaſily enough: and thoſe, not ſhifts; but, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient abſtertions of all ſuch calumnies. We can tell ſuch obiectors, that the Doctrines of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Perſeuerance</hi> doe not, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, lay any grounds for ſuch diveliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, (no more than good meat intends to yeeld matter of corrupt humors, in a bad ſtomack) but doe ſufficiently declare and teach the contrary, and all that are vnder the one, and partakers of the other, doe take out the contrary leſſon from them. Wee can tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, they who are elected to the <hi>end,</hi> are elected to the <hi>meanes,</hi> &amp; to a conſcionable vſe of the means wherby the end may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. So alſo the doctrine of perſeuerance teacheth that, though perſeuerance be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine yet it is alſo of the nature of that grace in which men perſeuere, to make and keepe them diligent in the vſe of all good means wherby they may, and doe perſeuere, and worke out their ſaluation with feare and trembling: according to that of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 2 <hi>Epiſt</hi> 1.8.) <hi>If theſe things be in you and abound, they make you that ye ſhall neuer be barren nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:7446:181"/> in the knowledge of our Lord and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Therfore, we vſually adde, that, if any ſhall or doe make any other vſes of theſe ſweet and divine Truths, therby to continue in ſinne, this is not to be imputed to the Doctrines themſelues, but to their wicked heads &amp; hearts that dare thus dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to draw them awry. The Goſpell which is the <hi>wiſdome of God,</hi> and <hi>the power of God vnto ſalvation</hi> to all that are ſaued, is yet held for no better than fooliſhneſſe to the reſt of the fooliſh and vnbeleeuing world. So the law which was ordained for the means of life, worketh death in all that abuſe it. But neither the law nor Goſpell are in fault of this; nor muſt therfore be concealed &amp; not taught &amp; inculcated, becauſe wicked men doe daily wreſt them to their owne damnation.</p>
               <p>And will not the ſame anſwere be good enough to vphold the point in hand againſt the ſame obiection? And, if it will: why ſhould it be held a greater indiſcretion to publiſh this doctrine ſo daily vſefull, and ſo fully comfortable to all the Elect, both pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:7446:181"/> and children: than to publiſh thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points before touched, as deepely char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the ſame ill conſequences, as this is? When I ſay, that, <hi>Jn the baptiſme of Elect infants, Chriſt doth, ordinarily, beſtow his ſpirit;</hi> I adde withall, that, <hi>this is not ſufficient for the ſaluation of ſuch as liue to yeares of diſcretion, but actuall converſion and renouation is to be expected and laboured for, in due and conſcionable atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vpon the vſe of all thoſe further helps and means which God hath ſanctified to that purpoſe.</hi> For ſo God vouchſafeth to grace all his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, that hee will not haue any of them deſpiſed nor neglected, by leauing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them vnvſefull, through ſuch an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of any one that haue gone before, as might leaue nothing to be done by thoſe that follow after. As he puts his ſpirit in the hearts of the elect, in their baptiſme; ſo he afterwards puts power into his word effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to call them home vnto himſelfe: &amp; then the ſame ſpirit workes mightily by that word, and infuſeth the <hi>habits</hi> of faith and all ſanctifying graces that doe accompany ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The word therfore, and the reſt of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:7446:182"/> Gods ordinances muſt be carefully humbly and conſtantly attended vpon, by all that expect any actuall and ſenſible aſſurance, &amp; comfortable feeling of the ſpirit beſtowed on them in their baptiſme. As for ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon baptiſme, alone, making no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the word, and other means of grace ordained of Chriſt, but liue ſecurely in their ſinnes; they therby giue iuſt cauſe of ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they neuer receiued the ſpirit, in their baptiſme, nor were in the number of Gods elect whoſe names are written in the booke of life. If <hi>they</hi> will needs take offence at this doctrine, they take what <hi>was</hi> neuer <hi>giuen.</hi> The Godly Will imploy it better: and, for their ſakes, it ought to be not only ſomtimes taught, but often preſſed to the vttermoſt; vnleſſe wee ſhould ſuppreſſe euery good &amp; neceſſary truth wherof wicked men will make an evill vſe.</p>
